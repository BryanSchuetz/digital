The field of Information and Communications Technology for International Development – ICT4D – continues to change at a rapid pace, engage new actors at the local level, and vex development practitioners who want to run successful ICT projects that increase program impact, are scalable, reach millions, and are measurable. We get it. At DAI, we’ve been working in ICT4D for over a decade. Our team and staffing structure has shifted and evolved over the years as the field has advanced and changed. We’ve experienced the exhilarating moments when a project works better than ever expected, and seen the pitfalls when a project fails in unexpected and disappointing ways. That said, we know there is much room for learning, improving, and engaging new tools, new people, and ourselves in delivering on the potential of Digital for Development. We've launched this blog as one way to keep ourselves honest in the pursuit of that potential.

We’ll bring you insight from assignments in places as diverse as Afghanistan, Indonesia, Haiti, and El Salvador. We’ll review tools and summarize some of DC’s prolific ICT4D events. We’ll ruminate on digitizing physical addresses, teach you a quick lesson on how to use dendrograms by analyzing NFL stats, and talk you through what we learned hanging out with smartphone-savvy twentysomethings in Kabul. Throughout, we’ll challenge ourselves to deliver content that will bring you back.
