    <p>Launched in 2019, the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/mexico-prosperity-fund-mexico-financial-services-programme">Prosperity Fund Mexico Financial Services Programme</a> aims to create a more inclusive and competitive financial services sector accessible to all segments of Mexican society and market entrants. Despite challenges due to COVID-19, this project has been able to hit the ground running with Caravana FinTech, an initiative that seeks to increase adoption and awareness of financial technology (fintech) solutions that benefit micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). I recently spoke with Roberto Velez, FinTech Adoption and Socialization Lead, and Lorena Segura, FinTech Socialization Leader, about how the programme is supporting MSMEs to expand their reach and encourage the use of fintech solutions.</p>

    <p>We recently spoke with <a href="https://www.childrenshospitalvanderbilt.org/doctors/barkin-shari">Phanith Phan,</a> the CEO of Muuve, an innovative delivery services startup in Cambodia. Muuve was one of the startups involved in the 2019 <a href="https://www.smart.com.kh/smartscale-powered-by-seedstars-to-host-its-demo-day-in-phnom-penh/">Smartscale by Seedstars</a> accelerator, co-funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/cambodia-development-innovations">Development Innovations</a> project and telecommunications company <a href="https://www.smart.com.kh/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwreT8BRDTARIsAJLI0KLZGTfnbLbol8X5UuazEsB8sqzo_n9AF92h-QRptDHikMSmCCtMI2caAnohEALw_wcB">Smart Axiata</a>. This accelerator model was investor-led and focused on connecting scalable tech startups to mentors, investment advisory services, and targeted technical assistance. Muuve is one of Cambodia’s success stories in a growing <a href="(https://www.raintreecambodia.com/research)">digital ecosystem</a>—even through the COVID-19 pandemic. The young team also <a href="https://e27.co/cambodias-muuve-scores-funding-from-ooctane-to-take-its-food-delivery-service-to-new-cities-20200123/">secured investment</a> from Cambodian venture fund, OOCTANE, a few months after finishing the accelerator in 2019.

    <p>Cybersecurity and cyber resilience are becoming increasingly crucial considerations for countries seeking to assert sovereignty and self-determination. This desire is particularly acute in regions such as Eastern Europe, South Caucasus, and the Western Balkans, all of which face increasingly complex cyberattacks emanating from nefarious individual and nation-state actors. As these countries navigate digitalization and the interconnectedness of their critical infrastructure (CI) operations, including financial networks and government services, they must strengthen their capacity to address vulnerabilities caused by new technological developments and an increasingly hostile international security environment. Domestic leadership, regional cohesion, and international support are pivotal in strengthening cybersecurity capacity, legislative and strategic frameworks, and institutions in these regions.</p>

    <p>COVID-19 has caused major disruptions for people from all walks of life. It has dramatically changed the nature of activities we used to do in person, especially those aiming to bring people together to learn, exchange knowledge, and strengthen relationships. As we grapple with the uncertainty of how in-person education and training will continue as the pandemic evolves, many types of learning experiences have preemptively moved online, especially those for adults.</p>

<p>At the Center for Digital Acceleration, we see significant opportunities for creative digital collaboration that would have been impossible just a year ago. Electronic learning has emerged as a particularly interesting category for development solutions. Projects with goals that span the thematic spectrum—from strengthening agricultural supply chains to supporting rule of law to stemming climate change—are considering how to implement digital curricula and thinking carefully about what approaches could work best for their myriad stakeholder groups.</p>

    <p>The Western Balkans, like many regions across the world, is navigating the disruptive effects of COVID-19 on their economies, while also digitalizing numerous critical sectors. Critical infrastructure (CI) is <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/topic/critical-infrastructure-security">defined</a> as “the physical and cyber systems and assets that are so vital to [a country] that their incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact on physical or economic security or public health or safety.” Recent threats emanating from malicious individual and nation-state actors remind us that cybersecurity considerations are vital to mitigate potentially widespread and devastating effects. In fact, the need to focus on network and system securities is only accelerated with the unique nature of digital challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic in the region.</p>

Latvia—a small country of two million people wedged between Russia and the Baltic Sea—was <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1863/EE_20Year_Review.pdf">one of 11</a> central, eastern, and southeastern European states to graduate in the 1990s or early 2000s. After $57 million over <a href="https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACI589.pdf">eight years of USAID support</a> ending in 1999, what’s going on in Latvia now? Specifically, what’s going on in Latvia’s startup scene and in the digital realm?

    <p>What do cyber attacks, virtual learning platforms, and the spread of misinformation online have in common?</p>

<ul>
  <li>All have seen substantial spikes over the past four months.</li>
  <li>Each one would be nonexistent without digital technology.</li>
</ul>

<p>Technology has served as both an advantage and a hindrance during <a href="https://www.ictworks.org/tag/covid-19-response/">COVID-19 digital response</a>. On one hand, apps like Zoom have allowed people to stay connected with loved ones while safe at home, and many have been able to work remotely without major disruption to their jobs.</p>

    <p><em>Last week we shared that the Center for Digital Acceleration was launching our most recent Cybersecurity Frontier Insights research into user perceptions of trust and privacy in India and Ghana. Here are the findings from that report, which can be downloaded <a href="https://www.dai.com/fi-cyber-user-trust.pdf">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>Since the creation of the internet more than 30 years ago, our lives, economies, and societies have changed dramatically and the restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic have accelerated change even more. As we’ve developed seemingly endless new methods of online communication, commerce, and civic participation, the international development community has become more acutely aware of a growing digital divide: those who are poor, rural, remote, illiterate, female, or living with disabilities in emerging markets risk being excluded from the benefits of digital transformation. Therefore, especially in recent years and months, we’ve seen valiant efforts from governments, private companies, and the development community to bridge digital gaps aiming to enable more people to access and benefit from online services. However, as access and use has increased, so has the number of digital risks, with data breaches, fraud, surveillance, and cybercrime on the rise globally.</p>

    <p>The pandemic is affecting the way people interact with money; how much we spend, what we buy, and whether to opt for digital payments. In the United States, the switch to digital has even led to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/business/coin-shortage-penny.html">coin shortage</a>, and the rest of the world is more reliant on cashless options, too.</p>

    <p>I don’t think it will ever be possible to overstate the importance of data privacy. I also don’t think it will be possible to overstate the necessity of digital literacy. And unfortunately, I don’t think it will ever be possible to completely protect our online selves from data harvesting or tracking. However, there are measures we can take to keep our data where it belongs. These measures can be taken by anyone using a phone with access to the internet and help keep us from being tracked.</p>

    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted the world to increasingly rely on digital technology to survive. Children are using online platforms to learn. People are using digital payment software to send money to their loved ones, and local businesses are entering the digital space to deliver goods and services that are no longer offered in person.</p>

    <p>In late 2019 and early 2020, DAI and our partner <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/">Caribou Digital</a> worked closely with the former U.K. Department for International Development, now the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-development-office">Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office</a>) to analyse identification and registration systems in protracted and recurrent crises. For those interested in reading more about the research, the report can be found <a href="https://www.dai.com/uploads/bsic-MIS-2020.pdf">here.</a></p>

<p>In this blog—the second in the series—we will dig into data protection and the potential consequences of increasing centralisation. Through an assessment of the literature and existing practice, our research team found that implications of fragmented management information systems (MIS) can be grouped into the following thematic areas: political, protection, legal and ethical, commercial, and operational. As there are numerous risks and benefits of increased centralisation of MIS (our <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/management-information-systems-at-the-humanitarian-social-protection-nexus-interoperability.html">previous blog</a> outlined some of the arguments), we cannot possibly provide an exhaustive list here. But in this post, we will give an overview of some of the considerations, including where care needs to be taken before proceeding; where the political economy must be assessed; and where more data needs to be collected.</p>

    <p>For the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), project site visits are essential for country Missions around the world. Site visits are required as part of each Mission’s performance management and provide opportunities for staff to better understand each activity’s unique context and how local communities experience USAID support. This spring, the COVID-19 pandemic brought travel to a halt around the world. USAID project teams hustled to determine what essential activities could be continued safely, and what would have to be put on hold.</p>

<p>It quickly became clear that site visits could no longer take place. So how could projects—especially those in remote areas without reliable internet connectivity—replicate the important experience of visiting a project in the field?</p>

    <p>George Floyd. Breonna Taylor. Ahmaud Arbery. By now you know the story of the people behind these names and have learned about the violence that cut their lives short. You have heard their names cried out in the streets along with demands to dismantle systemic racism and you have witnessed how their untimely deaths launched a global <strong>conversation</strong> about racism, justice, and the value of black lives. For many, these three names reinvigorated a hunger for social justice and kicked off months of protesting, donating, reading, and conversing through confusion, anger, guilt, hurt, and hope. With this <strong>historic and emotional summer drawing to a close</strong>, I find myself wondering what will become of the hunger. As the shock and outrage subside, and corporate promises to “do better” ease mounting public pressure, I wonder how best to ensure this drive for social change lasts.</p>

The research explored the feasibility of designing humanitarian aid management information systems (MIS) to link with social protection systems and to support a transition, in the long-term, to state social assistance. Whilst the focus was principally on the interoperability of such systems, our legal, digital, and protection brains also pushed us to focus on the risks associated with data collection, sharing, and storage.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df">Digital Frontiers</a> project is issuing an expression of interest (EOI) to support the U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance (DRG) office’s Responding to Digital Threats Activity.</p>

<p>In the 21st century, digital tools increasingly are becoming irreplaceable assets for societies. While digital tools offer an unprecedented opportunity for vulnerable, underserved, and unserved populations to access information and services, they also expose people, organizations, and countries to risks—for instance, the incitement of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar through digital platforms like Facebook, the manipulation of electoral discourse through the spread of disinformation in places like Ukraine, Brazil, and Vietnam, and the reverberating effects of massive ransomware attacks felt in high, middle, and low-income countries alike. These trends pose a threat to rule-of-law, democratic process, and human rights worldwide. In particular, China is exporting to other countries an internet governance model that conflicts with U.S. values of promoting an open, interoperable, free, and secure internet and democratic norms.</p>

    <p><em>Open-data sharing can offer huge benefits for development. How do we get the private sector to contribute?</em></p>

<p>In my previous blog—<a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/information-liberation-what-is-open-data-and-why-does-it-matter.html">Information Liberation: What is Open Data, and Why Does it Matter?</a>—posted back in April, I wrote about the Open Data Movement, including its origins, advantages, and relevance to international development. The post referenced Microsoft’s announcement of its support for the movement, vowing to use the company’s resources to address the “data divide” that separates those with access to data and the ability to interpret it, from those without.</p>

<p>With data comes power: the power to make better, smarter decisions; to use information to your advantage; to understand trends and predict future ones. No one knows this better than the private sector—experts in collecting, organizing, and interpreting data to improve business decisions and operations.</p>

    <p>When DAI staff and partners ask us for examples of how our projects have successfully used digital tools, we inevitably describe the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/uzbekistan-usaid-agricultural-value-chain-activity-uzbekistan-uzbekistan-avc">Uzbekistan Agricultural Value Chains (AVC)</a> activity as one of the best examples. AVC strengthens agricultural value chains by engaging horticultural producers, processors, input suppliers, and exporters. With that goal in mind, it did not take long for the project to realize they could engage people through digital tools already widely used throughout the country to reach their target audience. They were right. A key part of this approach was understanding their audience and their social media habits—in short, knowing their users. As the project now looks to build on its success in using social media as a tool for development, it is creating a sustainability model based on insights from its target audience: horticulturalists in Uzbekistan.</p>

    <p>For those of us who work in digital development internationally, the pervasiveness of the global digital divide is constantly top of mind. The majority of our work requires us to understand the digital ecosystem in which we are operating to reach different segments of the population in a specific country. At home in the United States, COVID-19 and the push for virtual schooling and telemedicine has laid bare, for many Americans, how significant and challenging the digital divide is within the United States.</p>

    <p>COVID-19 pushed people into their homes and brought to light the different options that exist to transform the way we learn from in-person settings to online classrooms. Although online learning is not new, the adoption of these learning platforms by the general population has been slow in comparison to the development of new technology-enabled education solutions.</p>

    <p>In the age of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech">Big Tech</a> and social media, the term <em>algorithm</em> gets thrown around a lot to describe the unseen mechanism that determines what people see on social media or the suggestions that they receive on Netflix. But what exactly is an algorithm? And can an algorithm be biased?</p>

    <p>Within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Global Development Lab, the Center for Digital Development (CDD) addresses gaps in digital access and affordability and advances the use of technology and advanced data analysis in development. DAI’s <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df">Digital Frontiers</a> project works closely with the CDD team to roll out and implement USAID’s Agency-wide Digital Strategy, which was released in April 2020.</p>

<p>As part of the Digital Strategy, the Digital Skills Initiative is developing training sessions and resources geared towards USAID staff. These resources will support staff to increase their understanding of–and ability to use–digital tools and skills.</p>

    <p>As COVID-19 drives more people online for work, entertainment, and even connection to friends and family, digital and data security issues are increasingly important across the United States and around the world. However, citizen-focused digital and data security discussions are still in early stages in some countries, especially in Southeast Asia, and my home base, Cambodia. So—who really gets left behind? It is often the citizens and small companies that rely on digital tools, but do not all have strong cyber skills to safely do business online.</p>

    <p>Since the world was catapulted into a socially distant new reality earlier this year, donor-funded development projects have been forced to re-envision what it means to transfer knowledge, build capacity, and implement training for staff, partners, and beneficiaries. As a result, DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration has experienced a swell in requests to support the digital transformation of activities previously envisaged for in-person learning.</p>

<p>As we work to scale support to meet this rising demand, who better to consult on the topic than school teachers? Teachers and students around the world were thrown into distance teaching with little notice and wildly varied levels of preparation. This disruption sparked newfound—but long deserved—teacher accolades from parents suddenly playing an intimate role in their child’s daily learning. Surely anyone with the ability to command a 6-year old’s attention from 30 miles away is worthy of our discipleship. So how did they do it and what did they learn? I spoke with elementary, middle, and high school teachers to glean their insights into engaging learners at a distance. While they had much to share on the matter, what I’ve highlighted below are those takeaways most applicable to the field of international development.</p>

    <p>It’s been a hard couple of years for the internet. Between <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/social-media-content/">election interference</a> via social media platforms, disinformation going viral and <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/FFM-Myanmar/A_HRC_39_64.pdf">facilitating genocides</a>, and most recently, the rampant spread of a conspiracy theories that 5G internet broadband caused the <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/24/21231085/coronavirus-5g-conspiracy-theory-covid-facebook-youtube">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, optimism in the internet’s force for good seems shaky at best.</p>

<p>I was scrolling <a href="https://www.ictworks.org/tag/twitter/">Twitter</a> recently and saw a tweet that ironically, mournfully noted, “Remember when this was the platform that was going to save democracy?” I do indeed remember. Simpler times, my friends.</p>

<p>Internet platforms such as <a href="https://www.ictworks.org/tag/google/">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.ictworks.org/tag/facebook/">Facebook</a> have invested immense resources in countering the more nefarious consequences of internet-enabled bad actors, including significant investment in machine-learning capabilities to uproot disinformation and box out cyber criminals before real harm occurs.</p>

<p>These supply-side focused solutions are indeed powerful, scalable tools in the fight against digital harms. However, to date, there has been <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/the-missing-digital-principle-educate-the-user.html">less effort</a> to develop demand-side solutions at scale, such as meaningful, global <a href="https://www.ictworks.org/tag/digital-literacy/">digital literacy</a> and regulatory protections for users.</p>

    <p>Somehow, we have made it to the halfway point of 2020. This year has been <em>wild</em>, to say the least—<a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">more than 500,000 people</a> around the world have died due to COVID-19. The murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Riah Milton, Dominique Fells, Oluwatoyin “Toyin” Salau, and quite literally countless other members of the Black community have led to a crisis of conscience and a (sorely needed, long overdue, how-is-this-only-happening-now) reckoning in the United States. In all honesty, I wrote this post about disinformation and dating apps over a month ago. We held it because the light tone wasn’t right for the historical moment we found—and continue to find—ourselves in. I still think it might be too early. However, as my wise friend and colleague <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/authors/gratiana-fu/">Gratiana Fu</a> points out, the topic of disinformation is especially relevant, right now, <strong>precisely because</strong> disinformation about  COVID-19, Black Lives Matter, and many other topics is spreading so quickly. So, with no further ado—enjoy this silly little romp through the world of disinformation on dating apps.</p>

    <p>With each technological advancement, more decisions in our daily lives are made by algorithms. They increasingly determine what advertisements we see, whether we’re considered for a job, or which books and movies are recommended to us—and how and where law enforcement is deployed in our communities. The ongoing protests to draw attention to, and eradicate, systemic racism in the United States, and in other parts of the world, have made clear something we already knew—humans are biased. Because we are biased, the technology we create is biased, too.</p>

<p>Over the next several months DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration will explore this topic by trying to answer the following questions (and more) in a new series: How pervasive is algorithmic bias, and which platforms are the worst offenders? (b) How does algorithmic bias work, and how we can tackle it at a technological level? (c) What other responses—policy, digital literacy, and so on—exist to tackle this phenomenon? (d) What are the effects of algorithmic bias on the broader digital development sector?</p>

    <p>In the current climate of data collection and data harvesting by every website, company, government or official body that has access to your browser traffic, usage history, and location, your data is always at risk and vulnerable. To add to this, nothing is absolutely, unequivocally, 100 percent secure. Even air-gapped computers that have no connection to the internet, as demonstrated with the CIA-infected Iranian centrifuges with <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/">Stuxnet</a> are vulnerable.</p>

<p>Did that sound alarmist? Well, it was meant to be. The good thing is there are simple measures that anyone from web and software developers to computer laypersons can take to protect themselves from the inevitable breach of their data. The more aware we are and the more precautions we take to avoid exposing our “IRL”-selves to the ever-present threats, the better our chances are of staying secure.</p>

<p>For the past two months, COVID-19 has made its way beyond the borders of the United States and into other countries of the Americas, namely the second and third largest countries of the region: Brazil and Mexico. While the United States’ daily incidence of deaths slowly declines, Mexico reported its largest daily incidence yet with 1,092 deaths on June 4.</p>

    <p>Silicon chips are literally black boxes to most of us. We understand that transistors are somehow etched in tiny patterns on these silicon wafers, and that these patterns make possible the computers, phones, and other electronic devices that run our modern world. Digital solutions are built on a foundation of silicon, and the landscape of silicon chip production is changing in ways that could have far-reaching impact on how that foundation is laid, and by whom.</p>

    <p>As many countries struggle to manage the COVID-19 crisis, governments globally are looking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-30/the-world-embraces-contact-tracing-technology-to-fight-covid-19?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">data-driven technologies</a> to minimize cases or to help facilitate a transition out of lockdown. The technologies being claimed to protect, prevent, and track include <a href="corona.asan.gov.af">symptom tracking apps</a> that help us understand the disease, digital contact tracing apps that alert us to our interaction with the virus, quarantine enforcement apps that monitor people’s compliance (such as those in Hong Kong, Poland, and Kazakhstan; proposed in Russia and Egypt), and <a href="https://www.ukauthority.com/articles/open-university-develops-digital-certificate-for-covid-19-immunity/">immunity certification</a> that identify individuals who have had COVID-19.</p>

<p>In more developed nations such as the United Kingdom and United States, conversations around data privacy are rife. For example, the UK National Health Service (NHS) is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52441428">negotiating</a> with Google and Apple about the efficacy of its proposed contact-tracing app in light of the two tech giants’ stringent adherence to privacy.</p>

<p>In the face of serious threats, many of us might say we have a reasonable expectation that our government will use technology to track and pre-empt risks. In the same way we might expect protection from terrorist attacks, we may also accept such measures to be employed during a public health crisis like the current pandemic.</p>

<p>But the vital question is: how can we ensure that the deployment of these digital tools are effective and do not set a dangerous precedent of digital surveillance?</p>

    <p>The challenges of measuring the infection rates of COVID-19 are enormous for even the most prepared countries, given the need for testing to reach a significant enough amount of the population to accurately detect its spread. While the total number of recorded cases in the world thus far have mostly been in the United States, Europe, and East Asia, many low- and middle-income countries have begun to see increases in reported cases.</p>

<p>In Mexico, the number of cases has slowly risen. Public health experts have <a href="https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/coronavirus/experts-say-mexico-hasnt-done-enough-virus-testing/">urgently suggested</a> that testing needs to be dramatically increased to appropriately track the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the graph below shows, the <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries">numbers reported from Worldometer</a> corroborate this testing deficit, as Mexico has one of the lowest rates of testing per 1 million people in the region, even among countries of similar size and income per capita.</p>

    <p>During this unprecedented global economic downturn caused by COVID-19, accelerators, incubators, and other entrepreneurship support organizations have a valuable role to play in helping entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in emerging and frontier markets. Over the past two months supporting the <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-shell-livewire-global-consultancy">Shell LiveWIRE</a> global entrepreneurship program and the <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ghana-kosmos-innovation-center-kic">Kosmos Innovation Center</a>, DAI’s <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/sustainable-business">Sustainable Business Group</a> has worked closely with the Global Accelerator Network (<a href="C:\\Users\\ZRaheem\\Documents\\DAI\\Sustainable Business Group (SBG)\\Brown Bag Presentations\\10 Trends Changing Entrepreneurship Ecosystems\\Blog on Entrepreneurship Trends\\gan.co">GAN</a>) and the Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs (<a href="http://andeglobal.org/">ANDE</a>) to leverage technology in support of global entrepreneurship in emerging economies. For corporates, foundations, donors, and development banks that support similar entrepreneurship ecosystems, we offer some learning here from our projects and global networks.</p>

    <p>Less than two weeks ago, on April 21, 2020, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/04/21/open-data-campaign-divide/">Microsoft</a> announced its support for the growing open data movement through the launch of an “Open Data Campaign.” Having recently spent several days researching successful open data initiatives, the statement caught my attention. The World Bank uses <a href="http://opendatatoolkit.worldbank.org/en/essentials.html">the Open Knowledge Foundation’s definition</a> for open data. According to it, open data means data “can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose.” In practical terms, this means data that is both <em>legally</em> open, publicly accessible or with minimal restrictions, and <em>technically</em> open, published in electronic formats that are computer readable and nonproprietary. This type of data is not to be confused with “big data.” As I recently learned, there are differences. For instance, open data derives its value from the sharing of the data and its widespread availability, rather than the volume (as big data does). I won’t be spending more time on this particular topic, but if you’re interested in learning more, I highly recommend reading a <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/should-big-data-be-open-data.html">guest post</a> we published on the subject in 2016.</p>

    <p>Often in the early days of digital development, it felt like there was a small group of big, innovative brains in one room all working on similar visions of how best to leverage the growing presence of the iconic Nokia 3310 across the developing world. Frontline SMS, Ushahidi, Souktel, and other groups were leading the charge from various corners of the earth, and design luminaries such as Jan Chipchase were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/13/magazine/13anthropology-t.html">interviewed</a> in <em>New York Times</em> think pieces on how cellphones could end global poverty. When I moved to Palestine to work for Souktel at the end of 2010, I was often in the same room as ICT4D “godparents” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Banks">Ken Banks</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/waugaman/">Adele Waugaman</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Hersman">Erik Hersman</a>, pleading our case to skeptical mobile network operators and Silicon Valley types who found our little ventures thrilling in a slightly Orientalist way. With texting as the tech <em>du jour</em>, everyone codified similar lessons in real time around the successful design of, for example, mobile awareness campaigns. The ICT4D sector grew rapidly across markets, simultaneously building strong use cases for users and development practitioners alike. I do have some hilarious stories of mobile campaign lessons learned from the Somali piracy crisis, but I will save those for another post.</p>

<p>Now, all these lessons are relevant again as we globally try to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

    <p>Everyone is talking about digital transformation—especially now that digital processes and tools are a mandatory part of daily activities for most businesses, schools, and citizens across the world in response to the global COVID-19 outbreak. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and DAI have been working to enhance digital skills, improve connectivity, and enable locally led innovation for years. Today, we are all confronted with a new set of urgent challenges. How do we ensure that citizens can safely and effectively use digital technologies to advance their own economic livelihoods and those of their countries?</p>

    <p>The next installment in our COVID-19 analysis series connects the dots between the datasets we have explored in our previous posts and brings in a new dataset that came to our attention over the past couple of weeks. In this paper, we look at the relationship between country scores from the <a href="https://www.ghsindex.org">Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI)’s Global Health Security Index</a> and levels of response by country governments measured using the <a href="https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/oxford-covid-19-government-response-tracker%5D">Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker</a>.

    <p>While tackling the spread of the COVID-19 disease takes a multi-faceted approach, behavior change—especially around personal and respiratory hygiene, proper handwashing, social distancing, and so on—remains a critical need across countries where DAI and our clients operate. Further, as organizations and individuals increasingly embrace digital-based approaches to collaboration, communication, and information gathering, we are presented with an opportunity to incorporate these technologies across behavior change communication strategies. However, as many organizations have experienced since the start of near-global lockdowns, this transition to an all-digital way of working comes with unique roadblocks.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks, the DAI Center for Digital Acceleration has been exploring how digital communication tools can be used to build communications campaigns aimed at stemming the COVID-19 tide and spreading accurate information about targeted behaviors. We’ve pulled together some quick thoughts on the topic, but frankly, these are principles that apply in most <em>any</em> effort of this sort.</p>

I saw innovators employ entrepreneurial thinking to develop out-of-the-box, creative solutions to problems, helping hundreds of thousands of Cambodians—automated phone calls warning people of <a href="https://www.development-innovations.org/blog/the-tech-mermaid-alert/">coming floods</a> comes to mind, as does a mobile <a href="https://www.edemy.org/#tesdopi">test prep application</a> to help high school students prepare for national exams. It’s this entrepreneurial thinking that the world desperately needs in this time of hardship, where livelihoods, the economy, and social cohesion are being challenged in unprecedented ways. Which naturally begs the question: In the face of COVID-19, what happens next in Cambodia’s innovation community?</p>

    <p>One of the participants in the <a href="https://www.development-innovations.org/success-stories/think-global-make-local-3d-printing-propels-young-cambodians-future/">Think Global Make Local</a> product development workshop, sponsored by our <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/cambodia-development-innovations">Cambodia Development Innovations</a> project in 2016, created a design for a toy called <em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Doydoycompany/">Doy Doy</a></em>. With <em>Doy Doy’s</em> silicone straws and plastic connectors, kids can build complex structures. The product has gone on to achieve modest commercial success locally. I found <em>Doy Doy</em> instructive because of the way its creator, Em Chanrithykol, ended up manufacturing the toy’s plastic connectors. Because of a lack of local injection-molding capacity and administrative barriers to importing parts made by contract manufacturers outside of Cambodia, Chanrithykol turned to a less traditional method: He contracted a local firm to churn out the parts on a battery of 3D printers.</p>

<p>3D printing is slow, expensive, and inefficient. It is great for small runs of one-off items or prototypes, but it is a terrible way to mass manufacture a product. But the lesson of <em>Doy Doy</em> is that a bad way to mass manufacture a product can still be better than having <em>no</em> way to mass manufacture a product. This is why I am currently manufacturing personal protective face shields for Baltimore-area hospitals in my basement.</p>

    <p>Our work at DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration intersects with global COVID-19 responses in many ways. <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/covid-19-data-analysis-part-1-demography-behavior-and-environment.html">Earlier this week</a>, our data scientists presented an analysis of risk factors and <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/COVID-looking-for-the-helpers-in-the-hardware-community.html">last week</a> we got a glimpse at the hardware community’s approach to the crisis. There is another element to our work that I think is critical to highlight—digital ecosystem assessments.</p>

    <p>For many years, the support of international donors to civil society organizations and private and public sectors in the technology field revolved around the provision of equipment, hardware, and software. On many occasions, these types of support have proved ineffective. As <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261263057_Overcoming_ICT_project_failures_-_A_practical_perspective">researchers</a> wrote in 2013, these investments quickly became obsolete or abandoned. Since then, we in the digital development community have supported international donors and international programming to better integrate technology into our work.</p>

    <p>Digital technologies are revolutionizing the way we access information, financing, and networks—all critical tools for fully participating in the global economy. Yet, these technologies, most notably internet connectivity and mobile phones, are not reaching all people equally. In recognition of International Women’s Day, we are looking at one of the most pressing barriers women face to their economic advancement—the gender digital divide—and how DAI is addressing this problem through the U.S. Agency for International Development’s W-GDP<a href="https://womenconnectchallenge.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/newsletter_final.pdf"> WomenConnect Challenge</a>, implemented by DAI’s <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df">Digital Frontiers</a> project.

    <p>Since 2014, the digital landscape has significantly changed globally. First, and most obvious, the number of internet users has nearly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273018/number-of-internet-users-worldwide/">doubled</a> from 2.8 billion to more than 4 billion in the last six years. Second, and perhaps a bit less obvious, the number of cyber incidents, such as data breaches or cybercrimes, impacting the average internet user, has grown exponentially. For a while now, I’ve been thinking about what these cybersecurity trends mean for our work in digital development. I recently read an article that helped frame the challenge in a way that is easily digestible, even by the least digitally focused development expert.</p>

    <p>What is the best architecture for a management information system? I hate to say it, but it depends. Generally though, I do have an opinion, and while your mileage may vary, I think one model might often better serve more use cases.</p>

<p>At first glance, you might think our products team only builds full-stack web applications. That is only half our story. We also spend a significant time providing technical advice to DAI project staff and their government counterparts on the technology solutions they are looking to procure. I call this <em>translating:</em> taking the needs and requirements of the project and explaining it in technical terms to developers and IT experts. One common area we help project staff understand, update, or integrate is a management information system (MIS) in disparate and un-harmonized contexts.</p>

    <p>Since I began working with DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration, I have had the chance to explore many of the exciting opportunities presented by our quickly digitizing world. Though I spend most of my time researching how digital tools and service platforms impact economic empowerment and productivity in the agriculture sector, an area that I am eager to explore further is the role of data in policy and decision making.</p>

<p>In recent years, Kabul residents have lamented the hours-long queue to access services at their municipal office. Several weeks ago, Kabul Municipality’s solution was hard to ignore. News of a new citizen engagement app was seen displayed on 21 billboards throughout the city, broadcast on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqLA8GD-33I&amp;feature=youtu.be">local television</a> and <a href="http://www.outlookafghanistan.net/national_detail.php?post_id=25808">online</a> sites, shared on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KabulMunicipality/posts/2194828510813555">social media</a>, and proudly showcased by the Mayor of Kabul at a launch event that drew 250 attendees and local media.</p>

    <p>It is not a coincidence that the most developed nations are also the ones with the highest levels of entrepreneurial <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/economic-development-innovation-and-entrepreneurship_b_593167b7e4b00573ab57a28b">activity and innovation</a>. While starting from a minimal level of development helps the latter two, for example, through basic access to capital and institutional stability, the impact of innovation and entrepreneurship on the economy and society more broadly cannot be overstated. In fact, the impact goes beyond usual suspects such as increased productivity, competitiveness, and job creation, and spills over into areas as diverse as regulation, infrastructure, the environment, and social inclusion. Below I provide a (certainly nonexhaustive) list of six such effects. While every issue deserves an article (or even a book!) of its own, these are brief overviews of each point.</p>

    <p>With the fast pace of technological change, it can be difficult for development practitioners to keep up with tomorrow’s opportunities and risks. Even for more technologically sophisticated members of the community, the focus on technology often overlooks hardware and exclusively focuses on software. As we begin 2020, I wanted to share the five trends in hardware that I think international development stakeholders—implementers, policymakers, civil society, the private sector, and others—should be watching for changes in the near term.</p>

    <p>It’s the new year and you know what that means…New Year’s resolutions! If you’ve ever uttered the words “New year, new me,” you are far from alone. In 2019, approximately 60 percent of Americans set resolutions and according to a recent survey, the top three were all related to diet and exercise: <a href="https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/10-top-new-years-resolutions-for-success-happiness-in-2019.html">eating better, exercising more, and losing weight.</a> Sound familiar?</p>

<p>While self-help gurus and exercise enthusiasts may tell us that a little self-discipline is all it takes to achieve these goals, research in the field of health and nutrition has shown that one’s food environment—<a href="http://www.ncceh.ca/sites/default/files/Food_Environments_Public_Health_Practice_Dec_2015.pdf">the physical, social, economic, cultural, and political factors that impact the accessibility, availability, and adequacy of food within a community</a>—can have a larger impact on our health outcomes than we think.</p>

    <p>For the past few months, DAI has been working closely with the United Kingdom’s Foreign Commonwealth Office (FCO) to map digital ecosystems across the Western Balkans, and to identify areas where the FCO can support the technology sector in closing the digital skill supply-demand gap.</p>

<p>Through our research, we found a region that is well-placed to increase its share of the dividends of global digital expansion and interconnectedness. The Western Balkans boasts promising digital ecosystems, which are well on their way to creating significant economic growth opportunities, but that in many cases need investment and support to do so. With each country having its own specific trajectory and different operating environment, we have created a series of blogs, each outlining key findings from the six countries in the region: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, and North Macedonia.</p>

<p>First up, beautiful Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>

    <p>In our last post from 2019, we reviewed our top posts from the past year. The most-read articles covered a myriad of digital development topics—bridging the <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/lessons-learned-from-cambodia.html">digital gender divide</a>, <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/visualizing-remotely-sensed-data-true-color-and-false-color.html">visualizing remote sense data</a>, and insights into the <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/citizen-centered-design-and-frontier-insights-in-kabul-municipality.html">digital lives of Kabul’s residents</a> to design an open source transparency and citizen participation app. Over the last few years, we’ve seen a sea change in how digital tools and services impact people’s lives globally. Expect 2020 to be no different.</p>

<p>As we get ready for the new decade, here are some topics we’re thinking about when it comes to digital development.</p>

    <p>This year, Digital@DAI published more than 60 posts covering everything from trends in entrepreneurship ecosystems to the importance of user education for digital development programming and building on user insights to develop an open-source transparency and citizen participation application for the municipality of Kabul, Afghanistan.</p>

<p>We featured digital experts from organizations such as Massachusetts Institute for Technology (MIT)’s D-Lab and information sciences and technology experts from across DAI and from our partner organizations. In addition, we featured program work we do with clients including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df">Digital Frontiers</a> program. Key topics of interest this year included artificial intelligence, agriculture, citizen engagement, decision support, cyber and trust, and ICT policy.</p>

    <p>This week marked the 71st anniversary of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> (UNDHR)—a founding document which set out, for the first time, fundamental human rights to be universally protected. Working in international development, most of us are committed to the 30 rights laid out in the UNDHR. As the digital revolution evolves, countries have adopted a myriad of legal frameworks to protect citizens in the digital space. These laws include those focused on privacy and data protection. However, often, these policies are not aligned with the most recent technological advancements.</p>

<p>In the humanitarian and development sectors, we are digitising faster than the <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/future-financial-assistance-outlook-2030-enaresfr">legal and ethical frameworks</a> governing this digitisation. Some fear that the technology sector remains virtually a <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25156">human rights-free zone</a>.</p>

    <p>Since 1970, DAI has worked in 160 countries on development issues ranging from good governance to environmental problems. But what about scientific policy-oriented initiatives in our backyard? With a headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland, DAI is surrounded by a vibrant and diverse social and ecological community, and civil society organizations that focus on sustainable development. At the Center for Digital Acceleration (CDA), we’ve had the good fortune of engaging two such organizations— <a href="https://www.spacreek.net/">Spa Creek Conservancy</a> (SCC) and the <a href="https://www.aacc.edu/about/schools-of-study/science-and-technology/environmental-center/">Environmental Center</a> at Anne Arundel Community College (AACC)—that combine formal academic research with citizen science and use data to bring awareness to the health of the Chesapeake Bay watershed.</p>

    <p>As we enter what the World Economic Forum refers to as the “<a href="https://www.weforum.org/focus/fourth-industrial-revolution">fourth industrial revolution</a>”—a profound transformation of industries and institutions driven by artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and augmented reality—international development practitioners are shifting toward data-centric business practices that require new systems, more efficient work flows, and modern skill sets. While the promise of newly available data is driving a desire to answer new analytical questions, lessons from more than 50 years of development projects lay dormant in Word and PDF documents stored in disparate folders, databases, and online portals by a wide array of stakeholders.</p>

    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies, although still relatively new concepts, are garnering a vast amount of interest in international development across sectors and geographies. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Center for Digital Development (CDD)’s Strategy &amp; Research (S&amp;R) team published a report in 2018, <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/machine-learning/AI-ML-in-development">“Reflecting the Past, Shaping the Future: Making AI work for International Development”</a>, based on extensive research on this rapidly growing field.</p>

<p>USAID would like to translate the report’s recommendations into an actionable format so the lessons and good practices are accessible to USAID program staff and implementing partners that may have limited familiarity with, nor time, to devote to the topic.</p>

    <p>As an avid and committed reader of <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/">Digital@DAI</a>, you have no doubt come across our extensive coverage of the Cambodia <a href="https://www.development-innovations.org/">Development Innovations</a> (DI) project, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). My colleagues have chronicled efforts to address flooding by <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/civil-society-the-hard-ware-way-maker-lab-experiences-in-cambodia.html">building hardware</a> with locally available parts, the project’s <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/cambodia-civil-society-facebook.html">design research with civil society groups</a> in Phnom Penh, and everything in between. With a mandate to strengthen Cambodia’s civic tech ecosystem and facilitate connections between civil society and the local tech community, DI was one of the only USAID projects that focused on technology and innovation ecosystems. But alas, all good things must come to an end—especially when the mission has been achieved and staff have worked themselves out of a job.</p>

The event brought together attendees from around the globe to connect over the theme of <em>Trust: humans, machines, and ecosystems.</em> The CGIAR Big Data Platform aims to “use big data approaches to solve agriculture development problems faster, better, and at greater scale than before.” The platform does this by connecting CGIAR-affiliated researchers from around the globe with development practitioners and ag-tech providers.</p>

<p>Not only did I have the rare opportunity to engage with super smart scientist-types who, unlike me, have job titles like “plant geneticist” and “mycology and plant pathology specialist,” but I also was compelled to consider the definition and role of trust in the application of data and technology to building resilient global food security.</p>

<p>Studies on how many disabled people live in Honduras are scarce. Results of a survey by the National Statistics Institute (INE), carried out in September 2002, showed there are 177,516 people with disabilities in the country. <a href="http://www.bvs.hn/Honduras/UICFCM/Articulo3_Vol83-1-2-Discapacidad.Sujetos.18-65a.pdf">Academic studies</a> tell a different story. They estimate that the number of people in Honduras with disabilities is closer to 381,287. These differing reports prevent the government, institutions, and civil society from effectively thinking through how ensure that services are accessible to those with disabilities.</p>

<p>Se estima que el número de personas que viven con algún tipo de discapacidad en América Latina y el Caribe entre 2001 y 2013 fue de más de <a href="https://www.paho.org/hon/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;view=download&amp;alias=383-identificacion-y-caracterizacion-de-las-personas-con-discapacidad-en-francisco-morazan-2017&amp;category_slug=fortalecimiento-de-sistemas-de-salud&amp;Itemid=211">70 millones</a> (o 12.5 porciento de la población regional total, el 12.6 porciento de la población de América Latina y el 61 porciento de los países del Caribe).</p>

<p>En Honduras los estudios acerca del tema de discapacidad son escasos y limitados. Según los resultados de la Encuesta Permanente de Hogares con Propósitos Múltiples del Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE) realizada en septiembre 2002, se encontró que en Honduras existían 177,516 personas con discapacidad, lo que representa una prevalencia de 2.65 porciento, con predominio masculino (55 porciento) en comparación de la población femenina (45 porciento). Sin embargo, estudios recientes del [Censo 2013 del INE] indicaron la existencia de 205,423 personas con discapacidad, y <a href="http://www.bvs.hn/Honduras/UICFCM/Articulo3_Vol83-1-2-Discapacidad.Sujetos.18-65a.pdf">otro estudio</a> de Flores, et al. (2014) encontró una tasa de prevalencia del 4.6 porciento, que significa un total de 381,287 personas que viven con discapacidades asumiendo una población de 8.2 millones.</p>

During the announcement, Rockefeller noted the significant impact of data science innovations in the most privileged communities, explaining its hope to replicate this effect to improve healthcare for people globally. The initiative aims to save at least 6 million women and children’s lives by 2030.</p>

    <p>I joined DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration (CDA) several months ago as an international development professional: familiar with ADS 302, Geo Code 937, Form AID 1420-17, among other industry acronyms, but a newcomer to the language of tech trends, digital buzzwords, and product design. I found the CDA team to be both inspiring and daunting, boasting individuals with unique expertise and passions—whether <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=cyber-security-series">cybersecurity</a>, <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=human-centered-design">human-centered design</a>, <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=remote-sensing-series">remote sensing</a>, <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=blockchain-serieshttps://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=blockchain-series">blockchain</a>, or the <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/what-good-is-the-internet-of-things-to-people-who-dont-have-internet.html">Internet of Things</a>.

If you, too, are new to this sphere, what do you need to know to integrate digital tools into your development programs or proposals? Below are some key points to get you started.</p>

    <p>Throughout my life, I’ve heard women grumble about using technology—from my mom, from friends in school, and from work colleagues—yet these are highly educated, often extremely logical thinkers that excel at, well, Excel!</p>

<p>The irony of the situation has been troubling me in the past few months. Why? Because there is a clear contrast in attention paid to the benefits of empowering women and girls through technology in low-and middle-income countries, with the attention paid to empowering women and girls through technology in high-income environments.</p>

    <p>Makerspaces—akin to coworking spaces with tools such as 3D printers and computer numerical control (CNC) mills as well as more traditional woodworking and metalworking items—offer participants access to equipment traditionally the domain of specialists or well-funded firms. Along with the proliferation of independent makerspaces starting in the mid-2000s, national organizations emerged to promote the model and connect regional maker communities, as well as offer a commercial platform for vendors making innovative tools for that market.</p>

    <p>What kind of images do you think of when you imagine Google Maps of our planet? Landmarks? Roads? Roads on top of satellite imagery? When we see that satellite imagery base map, we generally expect to see a representation of the earth that matches our reality. This is what we call in the world of remote sensing, “natural color.” For the average person, this use of earth-sensing satellites is the most useful, but in reality it represents only a fraction of the information gathered.</p>

    <p>One of the ways DAI tackles global challenges is by partnering with other innovators to invest in promising solutions. In joining forces with tech startups that align with our mission, we bring the power of technology and entrepreneurship to bear on global development challenges.</p>

<p>In 2016, for example, we supported four startups through our ‘<a href="https://www.dai.com/news/dai-and-partners-launch-innovation-action-challenge">Innovation into Action Challenge</a>’, including education tech firm <a href="https://www.laboratoria.la/en">Laboratoria</a>, renewable energy enterprise <a href="https://solarsister.org/">Solar Sister</a>, and m-health platforms <a href="https://clickmedix.com/">ClickMedix</a> and <a href="http://www.thinkmd.org/">ThinkMD</a>. Earlier this year, we <a href="https://www.dai.com/news/dai-global-health-invests-in-mhealth-leader-clickmedix">announced</a>  our investment in ClickMedix. We’ve also invested in Ghanaian startups that emerged from the <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/new-cda-insights-publication-building-the-future-of-tech-enabled-agriculture.html">Kosmos Innovation Center</a>. Keeping with this tradition, DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration is pleased to announce a new strategic partnership with our friends and colleagues at <a href="https://skilllab.io/">Skilllab</a>.</p>

    <p>When I first began learning about digital development, I thought of it as a new frontier that could push international development out of its modus operandi. New digital tools could provide individuals, communities, governments, and organizations with new sources of information at rapid speeds—enabling new means of collaboration to propel development objectives.</p>

<p>Digital technology is unique for two reasons. First, digital is <em>informative</em>—providing users with increased access to new information and opportunities at their fingertips. Second, digital is <em>informed</em>—enabling users to input information that will conceivably be used by industries and governments to tailor and update their products and benefit their business and economies to improve customer experiences.</p>

    <p>We live in exciting times. The ways in which we store and engage with health data have been transformed with the creation and adoption of digital health technology. Whether it’s using a Fitbit, accessing your vaccine records online, or virtually connecting with your doctor, understanding your health status in real time has never been easier… for some of us. We at <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/global-health">DAI Global Health</a> are working tirelessly to increase access to healthcare in low- and middle-income countries by leveraging digital health technologies. The goal is to empower patients and professionals providing care to them to use data to make smart decisions.</p>

<p>Identity is deeply personal. Issues of identity are complex and tied up with power, privacy, and protection. Yet identifying constituents is often critical to organizing and managing global development projects. Decades of development work have relied on ad hoc identity systems to administer programs, yet today we find that nearly 1 billion people still lack representative identification.</p>

<p>USAID’s 2017 report <em><a href="https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/15396/IDENTITY_IN_A_DIGITAL_AGE.pdf">Identity in a Digital Age: Infrastructure for Inclusive Development</a></em> documented some of the complexities that arise when we create or use digital ID in development programming. Done well, these systems can provide a unique, trusted, multipurpose ID to everyone, which is key to economic and social development.</p>

<p>When you walk into a room full of government officials, civil society organizations, and private companies discussing cybersecurity, you expect to hear disagreement. The exact opposite happened during the recent DAI- <a href="http://socialboost.com.ua/">SocialBoost</a> Cybersecurity Roundtable and Workshop in Kyiv, Ukraine.</p>

<p>The event started with a panel discussion with representatives from a myriad of government institutions working to address Ukraine’s <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-cyber-war-frontline-russia-malware-attacks/">cybersecurity challenges</a>. Representatives came from the Ministry of Energy, the Pension Fund of Ukraine, State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine, the Presidential Administration, Ministry of Infrastructure, and National Information Systems. Joining them were representatives from the company Information Systems Security Partners (<a href="https://www.issp.com/">ISSP</a>) and the law firm <a href="https://sk.ua/">Sayenko Kharenko</a>.</p>

<p>Cупротив та неузгодженість — напевне, той асоціативний ряд, який спадає на думку, коли уявляємо, що в одній кімнаті мають зустрітися державні управлінці, громадський сектор та представники бізнесу для обговорення тонкощів кібербезпеки. Проте, на Cyber Security Day - серії подій, які команда SocialBoost нещодавно організувала з новим партнером DAI, нам вдалося досягти абсолютно іншого ефекту.</p>

    <p>Let me introduce you to Latifa Yari, a 24-year-old student who will graduate from the Niger <a href="http://estniger.net/">Higher School of Telecommunications</a> (E.S.T.) this year with a degree in computer science. In 2018, Latifa won the <a href="https://www.girlsinict.rw/missgeekafrica">Miss Geek Africa</a>* competition with an app called Saro (“security” in Hausa) that connects emergency response services to citizens who have been in accidents. After that win, she founded the startup InnovElle, to develop digital social solutions and coach girls and women in digital technology. Latifa’s accomplishments are impressive and in the context of Niger, where there is a large digital gender divide, they are astounding. This is why during a recent trip to Niger I reached out to Latifa (thanks, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/latifa-yari-57460b161/">LinkedIn!</a>) to learn her story.</p>

    <p>When Facebook announced its first foray into the digital financial space with its new digital currency <a href="https://libra.org/en-US/white-paper/">Libra</a> last month, the digital development community collectively sighed and Twitter lit up with both praise and concern. While it’s easy to get out the pitchforks for something like this—and in many ways rational, given how Facebook was manipulated to exacerbate the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/technology/myanmar-facebook.html">Rohingya crisis</a>, used by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cambridge-analytica-facebook-privacy-awakening/">Cambridge Analytica</a>, and part of a myriad of other <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/timeline-facebook-s-privacy-issues-its-responses-n859651">breaches</a> of trust in which Facebook has proven itself a questionable steward of its self-built digital nation—I’m not going to take a side on whether Libra is good or bad. Rather, in this blog, I will lay out some key questions and considerations that need to be fully addressed.</p>

    <p>As a product development team, we spend a lot of time listening to the needs of users, particularly when it comes to their desire to collect and analyze data. And while projects have unique needs, they often ask for a common set of technology solutions. These include the ability to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Digitally collect and manage data - offline or online as mobile bandwidth permits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn as much as they can from their data, often through a series a dashboards or reports.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Upload products and share learnings with a public audience.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maintain an internal system for data sharing, so that people only have access to certain information.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Most importantly, these tools should be easy to use, and ideally not too expensive to build or maintain.</p>

<p>All of these are reasonable requests. If prioritized, organizations should be able to develop and maintain highly functional data management and analysis solutions. So why do so many organizations struggle to maintain these kinds of systems?
In this article, I’d like to outline two very different routes that organizations can take when trying to build out their systems: 1) completely proprietary solutions v. 2) open source technologies.</p>

    <p><img src="/uploads/Digital%20ID%20small-1-97efcb.jpg" alt="Digital ID small-1-97efcb.jpg" class="float-left" />Any ID—whether state-issued or purpose-made for services such as cash transfers—in some way reflects levels of equality, whether these are inherent in the technology or prevalent in the social ecosystem. For instance, <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Digital-identity-opportunities-for-women-Insights-from-Nigeria-Bangladesh-and-Rwanda-Web.pdf">research from the GSM Association (GSMA)</a> in Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Rwanda showed that citizens feel that equality in national ID is important as it reflects equality in citizenship status for men and women. If a biometric-based ID card is created in a refugee camp to facilitate cash transfers, every person living in that camp can rightfully expect to be registered regardless of age, gender, or ethnicity.</p>

<p>We list a number of ways in which bias can manifest in digital identities to kick off some discussion and move toward solutions. While reading this, I encourage you to think how we can make sure digital ID systems are inclusive.</p>

    <p>You saw it coming. You’ve been collecting geospatial data on your projects for years. Maybe uploading it to a faraway server or sharing it with local partners…or stashing it away on your laptop or external hard drive. But no one else was ever able to use it. And you were sort of irritated that you had to ask a million people for the same data every time you started a new development project in a different country.</p>

In the three years since the KIC’s launch, funders of all sorts—from bilateral donors to corporate social investors—have embraced the potential of Africa’s growing startup ecosystem to support socio-economic development and create new solutions to some of the continent’s most persistent challenges. In that time, KIC and DAI have learned a lot about what it means to support youth-led technology entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>We’ve compiled our findings in the latest <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/digital-acceleration-solutions/cda-insights">CDA Insights</a> paper titled, ‘<a href="https://www.dai.com/uploads/kic-27672d.pdf">Building the Future of Tech-Enabled Agriculture.</a>’ In addition to providing lessons for both funders and implementers in this sector, we created profiles of select KIC entrepreneurs and captured their journeys.</p>

<p>Durante más de un siglo, la roya ha representado una seria amenaza para la industria cafetalera mundial, especialmente en la era del cambio climático. No obstante, la toma de acciones eficaces y de forma coordinada entre los países centroamericanos productores de café ha sido una tarea difícil de lograr. En consecuencia, esta enfermedad ha continuado propagándose y sus efectos han sido devastadores. Entre 2012 y 2013, la roya ocasionó que la región centroamericana experimentara una reducción del 15 por ciento de su producción de café, lo que incluyó un alarmante 31 por ciento en Honduras. El gráfico siguiente muestra las pérdidas que experimentó cada país durante este período.</p>

<p>Coffee rust has menaced the global coffee industry for more than a century, but particularly in the era of climate change. Nevertheless, effective, coordinated action between coffee producing countries across Central America has remained elusive, and as a result the disease has spread—to devastating effect. In 2012 and 2013, coffee rust reduced the region’s coffee production by 15 percent, including a staggering 31 percent in Honduras. The figure below shows the losses each country suffered during that season.</p>

    <p>The Merriam-Webster Dictionary offers <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scale">seven</a> definitions of “scale,” involving variously weight, fish, climbing, maps, music, and—unexpectedly—lumber. Notably, none of these meanings is a synonym for “to embiggen,” the usage favored in the tech and development worlds. In these environments, which share little else, taking something “to scale” always seems to evoke Carl Sagan-esque notions of quantity. What this reductionist approach to vocabulary loses (in addition to small stiff plates that cover much of the body of some animals) is the range that makes this word truly useful. In English, if not in Silicon Valley, you can scale <em>up</em>, but you can also scale <em>down</em>.</p>

    <p>The technology revolution in Nigeria is remarkable compared to other countries in Africa (the country completely skipped the landline stage of development!). As one of the top destinations for investment in Africa, Nigeria is home to booming tech startups that provide a collaborative environment for entrepreneurs across sectors. Powered by the Nigerian government’s commitment to digital access, the digital ecosystem in Nigeria is likely to evolve further. Within this context, <a href="http://">DAI’s office in Nigeria</a> recently hosted two roundtables—one in Lagos and one in Abuja, both featuring insights from DAI’s Vice President of Technical Services, Brigit Helms, who recently published <a href="https://www.dai.com/news/access-for-all-dais-brigit-helms-launches-her-new-book-on-economic-inclusion">“Access for All: Building Inclusive  Economic Systems.”</a></p>

    <p>Digital technology has revolutionized the world by providing instant access to information, finance, and networks—all of which are necessary for women to reach their full economic potential and create more self-reliant communities.</p>

<p>Today, 1.7 billion women in low- and middle-income countries still <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GSMA_The_Mobile_Gender_Gap_Report_2018_32pp_WEBv7.pdf">do not own mobile phones</a>. The internet user gender gap is greater than 40 percent in some countries. The persistent gender digital divide is reinforcing—and even exacerbating—existing socioeconomic gaps between men and women.</p>

<p>Advancing women’s digital connectivity is key to promoting their empowerment in an increasingly digital world.</p>

    <p>Hi, Digital@DAI readers! My name is Inta, and I am the newest staff member at DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration. I come to DAI from GeoPoll, a U.S. registered small business in the mobile for development space. Making the transition from a small business specializing in ICT4D to a large business with a rockstar ICT4D team has given me some unique insights on the needs of small businesses. It has also provided me a big platform (thank you, Digital@DAI!) to share them with others, particularly people working for other major players in the international development sector. Below are some tips for using smaller, specialized technology firms—particularly U.S.-registered small businesses—more effectively in your development projects:</p>

    <p>Earlier this year I underwent a major life transition. After over four years living in Southeast Asia while supporting DAI’s <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/southeast-asia-asean-us-partnership-good-governance-equitable-and-sustainable">ASEAN-U.S. PROGRESS</a> project, I packed up my Jakarta apartment, shipped my belongings, and said farewell to the people and place that had become my home. The year 2019 was certain to be one of adjustment and inescapable reverse culture shock as I transitioned to life in America and a new position at DAI’s Bethesda, Maryland, office.</p>

    <p>Geographic information systems (GIS) are often misunderstood, or unknown to many. Even in the development community, we often have a shallow understanding of the technology once we delve into methodologies or use cases—particularly with satellite imagery, or more aptly, remotely sensed data. GIS and remote sensing are not synonymous, but scientifically and inextricably linked. When choosing a GIS/remote sensing methodology or technical analysis component for a project, it is important to understand the strengths and shortcomings of the available tools.</p>

    <p>Human-centered design (HCD)—the design and management framework pioneered by greats like IDEO.org and taught in countless design and business schools—is taking the development world by storm. And rightly so, in our opinion. HCD’s focus on empathy and creativity helps us design better, more sustainable solutions to some of the most difficult development challenges. We won’t go into too much detail on the broader HCD process or its application in digital development; my colleagues have written extensively on the excellent design work they’ve facilitated in places like <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/5-tips-for-doing-international-design-research.html">Cambodia</a>, <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/hcd-in-the-field-trading-counterfeit-rupees-for-real-insights.html">Nepal</a>, and <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/governance-app-guatemala.html">Guatemala</a>. What we’d like to do today, rather, is tell you about the time we almost perished while shadowing rangers in the forests of the Philippines, and what we learned in the process.</p>

    <p>A digital ecosystem is the how and why users interact with government services, digital financial tools, and each other using mobile devices. A single data point alone may not tell the whole story for digital inclusion and how to best reach those in low-connectivity settings globally. To help address this challenge, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Center for Digital Development (CDD) developed the mAccess diagnostic site, an online tool for global decision makers to analyze the availability, cost of connectivity, and number of users for more than 100 countries. The mAccess tool was launched in early 2016 and has been shared across USAID.</p>

    <p><img src="/uploads/Digital%20ID1.jpg" alt="Digital ID1.jpg" class="float-left" /> Welcome back to the Digital Identity series. This week we continue the discussion of digital identity, with a focus on the politics of digital identification.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the recognition that a formal identity is often a starting point for inclusion—without it, a person may not be able to access services such as health care, banking, or education. In humanitarian emergencies, a digital identity may be required to receive vital provisions such as food, water, and medicine.</p>

    <p>When thinking about the internet in an ideal world, I often think of an independent platform that provides a mechanism for free expression, commerce, and the exchange of ideas. Yet, as more and more of the global population comes online, the internet has become a reflection of global dynamics and geopolitical undercurrents. Today, this reality is manifesting itself around the impending roll out of 5G.</p>

    <p>DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration (CDA) relies heavily on ethnographic design research in our work. By focusing our efforts on people <em>and</em> the institutions around them, we:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Define the problem in their terms, not ours;</li>
  <li>Learn of, and about, previous attempts to solve the problem;</li>
  <li>Develop our understanding of local culture and history, as well as how people seek and share information and use mobile technology so we can meet them where they are;</li>
  <li>Mitigate the risks inherent to spending limited resources developing software or building digital tools, given the costs of doing so;</li>
  <li>Build ownership of the solution among the population; and…</li>
  <li>Enlist those who participate as promoters of the solution among their personal and professional networks.</li>
</ul>

    <p>I have a confession to make: I am a bonafide, card-carrying qualie. For those of you who aren’t familiar with this term, it’s a (nerdy) colloquialism to define people who are really into qualitative research. I swear, it’s a thing.</p>

<p>So yes, I am a qualie. I have been involved in conducting qualitative, ethnographic research in some way or another throughout the course of my sinuous career. I get jazzed by learning about people’s lived experiences—the barriers they encounter when attempting to improve their health and well being; the things that make changing behavior a snap; all of it. Throw some neuroscience in there to understand what’s happening in the brain and the ways in which emotional responses catalyze behavior change? Yes. Yes, please. I am in heaven.</p>

    <p>📱 Smartphone connections continue to rise and people, globally, love to game. The Global Systems for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) estimates that by 2025 78 percent of all developing market mobile connections <a href="https://www.gsma.com/r/mobileeconomy/sub-saharan-africa/">will be smart</a>. By that time GSMA predicts that India will be the second-largest smartphone market by adoption globally (ahead of the United States), with 1 billion smartphone connections. Interestingly, India is already among the top five mobile gaming countries globally, expected to surge to <a href="https://www.mmaglobal.com/files/casestudies/kantar_imrb_x_mma_x_pokkt_india_market_study.pdf">368 million gamers in 2022</a>. If this is a bellwether for developing markets, we can expect gaming to be a significant force across the global south.</p>

    <p><img src="/uploads/Digital%20ID1.jpg" alt="Digital ID1.jpg" class="float-left" />This post marks the launch of a Digital Identity series here on Digital@DAI. It is a pivotal topic to many of our technical areas: from health service provision, to cash transfers, and voter registration. It is also a topic garnering increased attention with the debate over privacy and data security—and the global refugee crisis reinforcing the <a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/213581486378184357/pdf/112614-REVISED-English-ID4D-IdentificationPrinciples-Folder-web-English-ID4D-IdentificationPrinciples.pdf">opinion</a> that there is “no single factor that affects a person’s ability to share in the gains of global development as much as having an official identity.”</p>

<p>Over the next few months, we will look at some of the issues and opportunities around Digital ID in the development space. Today, we look at informed consent: what it means to the development sector, the difficulty of getting it, and what we can do to make sure we aren’t leaving people behind, while respecting their privacy and the security of their data.</p>

    <p>Technologists and developers love to talk about the best tools for building new technology. MERN or MEAN stack, functional vs. object-oriented programming, vanilla development or frameworks. The internet is ripe with these discussions and attend any tech meetup and you’ll easily find multiple discussions comparing one tool to another. The performance and usability of one over the other, as if that is the goal.</p>

    <p>They say to write about what you know. For the first part of my career and through my formal education, my work was all based in the world of water and sanitation. Glamorous stuff—pipes and pumps, fecal coli-forms and treatment options, toilets and activated sludge. It made for great dinner conversation (or so says my wife). At some point, I made the transition from a water guy who worked with a lot of data to a data scientist who knows about water. And as I dive deeper into the analogies and lingo of modern data systems and tools, I lean on my engineering training to make sense of it all.</p>

    <p>Rapidly changing access to digital tools such as basic mobile phones is changing the landscape for how we can address the challenges to ending global hunger, undernutrition, and extreme poverty. “Despite our collective progress in global food security and nutrition over recent years, a projected 702 million people still live in extreme poverty; nearly 800 million people around the world are chronically undernourished; and 159 million children under five are stunted. Food security is not just an economic and humanitarian issue; it is also a matter of security, as growing concentrations of poverty and hunger leave countries and communities vulnerable to increased instability, conflict, and violence.” (U.S. Government Global Food Security Strategy 2017-2021).</p>

Last week, KIC Mauritania’s 2018 cohort of young entrepreneurs pitched concepts to a panel of judges, competing for more than $85,000 in total seed funding. Unlike KIC Ghana, which focuses solely on support to agritech startups, KIC’s Mauritanian startups have built a wide range of solutions across various sectors, from waste recycling to healthcare. Here’s an overview of this year’s finalists, their business concepts, and the final winners of the competition.</p>

    <p>Many in international development want to be “innovative,” but how do workplaces develop cultures that promote useful innovation? The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) launched Development Innovations (DI) in 2013 to help Cambodian civil society organizations and tech companies leverage technology to address social needs. This objective would <em>require</em> new ways of thinking to create new ways for solving problems.</p>

    <p>Researchers have demonstrated the capability of machine learning to help with everything from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/01/lets-save-the-bees-with-machine-learning/">saving honeybees</a> and <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/1/e024018.abstract">tracking flu vaccine uptake</a>, to <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-machine-learning-could-keep-dangerous-dna-out-of-terrorists-hands/">aiding in the fight against bioterrorism</a>, and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20181219-what-to-do-with-your-leftover-christmas-food">plenty in between</a>.</p>

<p>But machine learning can also be put to less-scrupulous uses just as easily. Social engineering is a type of cyber attack that deceives users into creating security breaches, typically through emails and phone calls (often called ‘phishing’), and the marriage of machine learning with social engineering is poised to be a burgeoning issue in the near future. This issue is a global problem, but developing markets are often at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/02/technology/hackers-find-ideal-testing-ground-for-attacks-developing-countries.html">highest risk for cyberattacks</a> due to the lack of capacity to defend against and track such attacks. As such, they often find themselves as the testing grounds for novel attack methods before they reach more developed markets.</p>

    <p>One of the attractions of awarding prizes in global development is that the prize sponsor shifts the responsibility of achieving results onto competitors. While this approach can inspire a range of creative solutions and spur a nascent market, it also means many finalists will develop something valuable whether they win the award or not. For a prize to be valuable to both sponsors and competitors, sponsors must clearly communicate prize objectives so that competitors have the best chance at success and can assess whether devoting resources to achieve those objectives makes sense for them, win or lose.</p>

    <p>We in the international development community talk a lot about privacy and security in digital development. We try to think through privacy and security in terms of the data we collect, what we do with it, and even how we address issues of <a href="https://lindaraftree.com/2017/02/06/responsible-data-case-studies/">consent around data collection</a>. There’s an <a href="https://digitalprinciples.org/principle/address-privacy-security">entire digital principle</a> about it.</p>

<p>In discussions like these, privacy and security are framed entirely in terms of the paradigm of extraction—collecting and gathering data <em>from end users</em> to organizations. This is an entirely valid and important discussion to continue having. However, there’s a discussion we’re not having that’s arguably even more important, and that’s around the privacy and security of users.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/">U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)</a> has worked with Missions to integrate digital tools and technologies into Feed the Future activities since 2015, first through the U.S. Global Development Lab-led <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/digitalag">Digital Development for Feed the Future</a>(D2FTF) initiative and now through the <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/organization/bureaus/bureau-food-security">Bureau for Food Security (BFS)</a> (BFS). BFS works with DAI’s <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df">Digital Frontiers</a> project, a buy-in mechanism that allows Missions to receive digital solutions for resilience and food security assessments as well as program, project, activity design, and implementation support.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/aphone.JPG" alt="a phone" /><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Photo credit: CABI</code></p>

<p>As part of this work, DAI-led Digital Frontiers is conducting a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QSMW65V">survey of agriculture projects</a> to understand their experiences using digital tools in their work. These findings will be used to inform BFS’s digital strategy. If you are working on an agriculture project, we are very interested in hearing from you.</p>

    <p><img src="/uploads/SDG9%20small-23e62a.jpg" alt="SDG9 small-23e62a.jpg" class="float-left" /> In our quest to increase digital access, we tend to focus on the dividends, rather than the negatives that can arise. We are understandably excited about <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/mediacentre/Pages/2018-PR40.aspx">edging closer to universal access</a> and the new business opportunities and improvements to service provision that accompany it. But while we are improving in our endeavor to promote online safety and security, bridge the gender digital divide, and include people with disabilities (all great stuff!), we could be overlooking some negative consequences of increased digital access.</p>

    <p>A recent report prepared by the <a href="https://www.amazoniasocioambiental.org/es/">Amazonian Geo-referenced Socio-Environmental Information Network (RAISG) </a>and <a href="https://infoamazonia.org/es/">InfoAmazonia</a>, in coordination with eight other Latin American institutions, published a <a href="https://mineria.amazoniasocioambiental.org/">map</a> that shows more than 2,000 data points across the Amazon where illegal activity is occurring. This includes illegal mining and logging in 96 protected areas. Most of the illegal activity is taking place in <a href="https://mineria.amazoniasocioambiental.org/">Venezuela</a> where there are a reported 1,899 data points documenting illegal mining or logging. Venezuela is followed by Brazil where 321 cases of illegal activity are recorded. In Ecuador, the number drops to 68, and in Peru, 24. For organizations, governments, or advocates looking to protect the Amazon, this digital tool seems like a blessing. Yet, based on my experience it’s unclear whether these information-streamlining tools are actually limiting illegal activity.</p>

    <p>On January 5, I posted the message below on Facebook to hold myself accountable to my New Year’s resolution.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/hanson%20blog%20pic-3811e6.png" alt="hanson blog pic-3811e6.png" /></p>

<p>It’s simple. I want tech businesses to grow and thrive in Nigeria <em>outside</em> of Lagos. I want to support someone who grew up in, works in, and wants to continue working in my hometown, Uyo. This is not just my resolution, but has been my life’s work since I started <a href="https://starthub.com.ng/">Start Innovation Hub</a> five years ago. Start Innovation Hub is an ICT firm and innovation lab that works to expand the tech industry by supporting tech startups and talented individuals in Uyo. We build skills and connect entrepreneurs to economic opportunities, as well as support local businesses by developing software solutions. You can’t deny that the tech sector in Nigeria is growing rapidly, but the concentration of firms in Lagos means that places like Uyo are left behind. Through Start Innovation Hub, I hope to change that.</p>

    <p>Technology and data are converging in ways that allow monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) professionals to more effectively monitor, evaluate, learn, and adapt on their projects. Dashboards are one of the key tools contributing to this trend, having become more accessible and user friendly through platforms such as <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/?&amp;OCID=AID719832_SEM_bHb24t0B&amp;lnkd=Google_PowerBI_Brand&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw08XeBRC0ARIsAP_gaQBWS9woBxKkiDNWqYJ1QffUY7fpDoUDQTRkOS4N15amKTJGVg8EmGMaAkDrEALw_wcB">Microsoft PowerBI</a>.</p>

<p>Dashboards are an information management tool that visually track, analyze, and display metrics and data points to monitor the status of a project. DAI is creating dashboards for all new projects to enable teams to learn, evaluate, and adapt to project realities in near real-time. Ultimately, these dashboards make for better monitoring and evaluation and—in turn—better projects. Therefore, it’s important to get it right. So where should you start?</p>

    <p>The headline says it all: “<a href="https://nordvpn.com/blog/biggest-data-breaches-2018/">Over a billion people’s data was compromised in 2018</a>.” Among the most egregious offenders were some of the most popular tech platforms in the world: Facebook, for example, admitted it had leaked the personal data of nearly 150 million users; Twitter leaked the passwords of nearly all 330 million of its users; and even mighty Google had two of its products hacked: Firebase (an app monitoring tool) leaked the data of more than 100 million users, and Google+ leaked 500,000 users’ personal info.</p>

    <p>Years ago, yours truly was struggling with a major life decision, one that had led to many a sleepless night: Where to go to grad school? I’d been accepted into a number of programs and was agonizing over my options. My dad had graciously taken on the role of my sounding board until one day he blurted out in frustration, “you have an embarrassment of riches, Rachel. Just decide!”</p>

    <p>It’s been about two months since I last contributed to the Cyber Security Series, but don’t let the time fool you into thinking we haven’t been engaging extensively on the topic. As many of you might remember, the Center for Digital Acceleration (CDA) published the <em><a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/digital-inclusion-and-a-trusted-internet.html">Digital Inclusion and a Trusted Internet</a></em> report in October on the topic. For those of you who have not read it, I highly recommend it, particularly if you’re interested in cyber security or data privacy.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/cybersecurity-series-part-1-trust-is-why-cyber-security-matters-to-digital-development.html?utm_source=related-box">first post</a> in this series focused on the issue of trust and the <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/cyber-security-2.html">second post</a> argued that investment in regulations that support the enabling environment, strong institutions, and skills of the population are key to integrating cyber security across a country’s economy. This post focuses on a more micro-level challenge—pirated software—and how addressing it is key to responding to cyber security overall.</p>

    <p>If you aren’t excited by the headline—you should be! In this blog I will highlight a few issues I run across when discussing projects or planning data analytics solutions. Going into the details of each of them would take quite some time, so I will keep the anecdotes (data?) brief. There will undoubtedly be many interpretations of the data -&gt; analytics -&gt; insights/information flow, but this blog is simply an opportunity for me to share my own thoughts. After all, what are we as good data stewards and scientists without proper debate?</p>

Meet Lida Loem. Lida is the co-founder of <a href="https://www.sheinvestments.com/">SHE Investments</a>, a social enterprise that helps Cambodian women turn their entrepreneurship skills up to 11 (yes, out of 10) with training, mentorship and networking in both cities and rural regions of Cambodia.</p>

<p>SHE’s vision is a world where investments in women in developing countries are seen as opportunity, not charity. They work with current and aspiring entrepreneurs across Cambodia, and see themselves as a catalyst for women’s economic empowerment through increased income generation and employment opportunities. Their work helps to bridge the gender gap in business and entrepreneurship, strengthening and diversifying Cambodia’s economy.</p>

    <p>Human-centered design (HCD) is a central focus of DAI’s. We’ve written extensively about how we work with our partners to follow this complex and time-consuming (but very important) process and even came up with a more concise, budget-friendly <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/dai-launches-human-centered-design-whitepaper.html">Lean HCD approach.</a></p>

<p>As part of our continued commitment to the approach, <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/authors/">Karim Bin-Humam</a> and I recently traveled to Ghana to run a workshop on HCD for the <a href="https://www.ssab-africa.net/">Sustainable Smallholder Agribusiness Programme (SSAB),</a> implemented by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH.</p>

<p>This was lean HCD on steroids: We asked participants to produce a HCD roadmap in just one day.</p>

    <p>Choosing just nine shining examples from more than 500 applicants of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/wcc">WomenConnect Challenge</a> was no easy task. The global call—put out in March by Ivanka Trump and USAID Administrator Mark Green—sought examples of the changing ways in which women and girls’ access and use of technology help drive quality health, better education, and improved livelihoods for themselves and their families.</p>

The cyber training was intended to equip foreign service officers with the knowledge and tools to represent the broad range of policy priorities enumerated in the President’s International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World.</p>

    <p>There’s a tendency in any field of business (and life!) to focus on the newest, shiniest objects. Just like obsession over the release of the latest iPad, the ICT4D community holds a special place in its heart for the newest technology offerings. Machine learning, blockchain, and the internet of things (IoT) come to mind today, whereas in years past it was crowdsourcing, social media, or smart phones.</p>

<p>Mozambique is no exception—whilst literacy rates there are low, and the ICT infrastructure and regulatory framework are underdeveloped, traditional banking is still not serving people’s needs. The financial inclusion rate is at <a href="http://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/3324">42% (Work Bank Findex 2017)</a> and there is a clear need for financial services to be available for poorer, more rural and marginalised populations.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/kosmos-innovation-center-wins-2018-p3-impact-award.html">award-winning</a> Kosmos Innovation Center in Ghana has completed its final round of pitches for the 2018 cohort, and as with <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/catalyzing-ghanas-growing-agritech-ecosystem.html">previous years</a>, the program’s (very) early-stage young entrepreneurs continue to impress. Unlike previous years, the eight finalists this year were given six weeks and a small stipend to develop their minimum viable products (MVP), in addition to nine months of KIC-funded capacity building and market research. This meant that each team had the chance to meet with users, tweak their revenue models and designs, and even raise revenue to demonstrate proof-of-concept. As a result, I found that this year’s teams were well ahead of their 2017 and 2016 counterparts—their pitches were more compelling; they were more confident in their ability to answer judges’ questions; and their nose for entrepreneurship opportunities was keener.</p>

<p>Here’s a run-down of each team’s business concepts for technology-driven Ghanaian agribusinesses.</p>

I highlighted that trust in digital tools should not be taken for granted, but rather constantly invested in by designing digital tools with user input, but also with security in mind. Now I will take a look at some of the other key analog complements that need to be considered when deploying secure, integrated digital systems for sustainable development.</p>

    <p>Over the last few weeks, DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration has been working closely with the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID)’s Malawi office to conduct a digital scoping study of its portfolio. Building on some of the <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/digital-insights-malawi-communication-among-rural-communities.html">user research</a> we’ve conducted in Malawi, we’re identifying areas where DFID can make small, focused investments in digital innovations to improve the impact of its programs. And we’re also helping the team build relationships with the small, but growing, group of Malawian technologists tackling development challenges with digital tools. As part of this effort, we put together DFID’s first-ever Malawi Digital Development Forum last week, which brought together local technologists, development implementers, government decision-makers, and DFID staff for a day-long technology exchange.</p>

    <p>Much has been written about the digital divide and the failure of ICT to meet the needs of the poorest users. As World Bank President <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/speech/2018/02/26/speech-by-world-bank-group-president-jim-yong-kim-at-the-gsma-2018-mobile-world-congress">Jim Kim says</a>, “We must continue to connect all people so that no one is left behind … because the loss of opportunities has a very high cost.”</p>

<p>In Central America, some of those ‘left behind’ include more than 135,000 fishermen. Without access to vital information about how climate change affects fishing, their very livelihoods are <a href="https://www.nacion.com/ciencia/medio-ambiente/cambio-climatico-golpea-pesca-artesanal-en-litorales-centroamericanos/PMD2I4PAQRAJVPHFR6MCYBDDCY/story/">under threat</a>.</p>

    <p>Happy hours are the sinew of the ICT4D community: They are how we connect. For a few hours each month, we put aside the titles, affiliations, competition, and enjoy each other’s company over a few drinks.</p>

<p>September was a particularly busy month on the ICT4D happy hour calendar, so let’s take a quick look back on what happened. Hopefully, you’ll join us for the next one!</p>

    <p>Think back to the last time you used a mobile app(lication) with unwieldy menu placement, indecipherable icons, and inconvenient user-configurable options. These may seem like minor nuisances in the everyday life of app interaction, and frankly, most users probably never notice (or maybe don’t realize that they notice) or hardly care. But user experience in application design is critical to ease of use, efficient navigation, and longevity of mobile-based application technologies.</p>

    <p>Fortnite—a free, online multiplayer video game—has amassed more than <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/announcing-2018-2019-fortnite-competitive-season">125 million players</a> worldwide during the mere 14 months since it debuted in July 2017. The game features a fast-paced, <em>Hunger Games</em>-inspired format mixed with community, celebrity, and story, and so far it’s working.

    <p>Ah, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_days">dog days</a> of summer. Usually a slow time for work, that means there’s extra time to sit at your computer looking for good stuff to read, struggling with either being uncomfortably warm from the summer heat or excruciatingly cold from over-aggressive office air-conditioning. We get it. We got you. Fresh ICT4D reads from our August Roundup below!</p>

    <p>A tectonic shift is taking place in commerce, and we’re all a part of it. At its core, it boils down to one concept: accountability. The accelerating movement toward web-based management tools, data analytics, and automation among businesses—coupled with the rapid growth in mobile phone technology—has reduced the cost of doing business, slashed barriers to entry, and reduced the time elapsed from concept to market-ready solution. The result is increased competition, more customer choice, greater accountability to the customer, and the sound of the sledgehammer falling upon formerly protected industries. Customers in the many business-to-consumer verticals (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2018/08/13/middle-class/?hpid=hp_no-name_opinion-card-f-2%3Ahomepage%2Fstory">admittedly not all</a>) have more bargaining power than ever before, and can hold businesses accountable for poor performance by downloading a competitor’s solution with a few simple clicks.</p>

    <p><em>This article is part 2 of a series exploring the basics of importing and analyzing data in RStudio.</em></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/getting-started-with-rstudio.html">previous post</a> we introduced the R programming language, RStudio as a development environment, and examined rainfall data for May. The data we analyzed was stored in Google Docs. We used some functions to pull the data into our work environment, and displayed the data over time using a line graph. In this post, we’re going to make an improvement to this analysis. Specifically, we’re going to streamline the way we access weather data.</p>

    <p>We’ve read the headlines: large-scale breaches of highly sensitive information in the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/09/opm-now-admits-5-6m-feds-fingerprints-stolen-hackers/">United States</a>, in the <a href="http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/55m-registered-voters-risk-philippine-commission-elections-hacked/">Philippines</a>, in <a href="https://www.devex.com/news/new-security-concerns-raised-for-redrose-digital-payment-systems-91619">Nigeria</a>, in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/04/india-national-id-database-data-leak-bought-online-aadhaar">India</a> … the list goes on. The message is consistent: somebody, somewhere, needs to do something to protect us. Enter the <a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/">General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR)</a>, the EU’s (in)famous answer to protecting the personal data of its citizens. Some applaud it as the world’s strictest privacy standards; others consider it outdated from the start. (We’re in the age of blockchain and AI; you tell me how to exercise <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-erasure/">right to erasure</a> here.) Either way, GDPR concepts are useful to international development contexts.</p>

    <p>Along with human-centered design and lean startup, co-creation is an approach arising to prominence in the development lexicon over the past five years. Some of us (myself included) have used “co-creation” without  understanding what it means, simply assuming it was an event that brings together a variety of partners to brainstorm ideas to solve a problem. Only when I attended the <a href="https://fallarmywormtech.challenges.org/">Fall Armyworm Tech Prize</a> co-creation workshop from June 26 to 29 in Kampala, Uganda, did I grasp the nuances of co-creation and realize the significant benefits it holds for the end users of co-created products.</p>

    <p>I can’t remember exactly what I was doing when the grenade went off up the street—probably brushing my teeth or something mundane like that. I was halfway through my two-week visit to Ethiopia and looking forward to getting out in the field. I was also completely unaware of what had just happened. It was a sobering day. I spent all afternoon watching the news. First one person confirmed dead, then two. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/06/23/622855931/grenade-attack-tears-through-rally-for-ethiopian-prime-minister">One-hundred and fifty or so wounded</a>. Fear on the faces of a populace that had recently been so full of hope.</p>

    <p>Let me start by saying that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) Grand Hack is <em>kind of a big deal.</em> I don’t make the point as an affront to other hackathons—certainly not <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/top-3-climate-change-concepts-from-the-2016-nasa-space-apps-challenge-bogota.html">DAI’s own</a>—but not many other hackathons can claim to have generated more than $150 million in venture capital and spawned more than 40 viable companies. Those two facts qualify the Grand Hack for royalty status among hackathons, which makes it even more surprising that the event is run entirely by students, MIT’s Hacking Health group. It’s also the reason why I was so excited to get a taste of MIT’s secret innovation sauce from the inside—as a mentor, alongside my colleague <a href="https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/kristen-roggemann">Kristen Roggemann</a>.</p>

    <p>From 2010 to 2014, the Central American coffee bean suffered from a disease that rocked the economies of the region. Exports declined by 55 percent. From 2012 to 2013 some 374,000 jobs were lost—17 percent of the labor force. <strong>Roya</strong>, or <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20171106-the-disease-that-could-change-how-we-drink-coffee">coffee rust</a> threatened the livelihoods of <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/file_attachments/ib-coffee-rust-employment-collapse-central-america-140814-en.pdf">nearly 2 million</a>.</p>

<p>Coffee rust is a fungal disease that covers the leaves and prevents photosynthesis, slowly constricting plants’ ability to process sunlight, reducing bean yield and eventually starving the plant to death. The warmer, wetter conditions wrought by climate change creates a better ecosystem for the fungus to grow. Its impact on Central American economies is significant as coffee exports are the region’s largest source of foreign income and coffee supports a vast supply chain, in turn supporting dozens of adjacent industries.</p>

    <p>In comparison to other development sectors, health programs have historically been early adopters of digital tools. What have we learned over the last 10 years, and where are we heading? How can we build systems that integrate data from independent actors across the health ecosystem? How can we use lessons learned to support innovation? How can we adapt to expanding digital access and support the growth of local capacity?</p>

    <p>The rapid expansion of mobile and internet access in the developing world holds the promise of catalyzing resilient economic and social growth. However, the availability and cost of connectivity is a significant barrier to fully realizing that vision.</p>

    <p>Are you a nonprofit focused on improving maternal health outcomes? Or maybe you’re a civic engagement organization that encourages young people to become more involved with their local governments. No matter the objective, technology can both help you be more efficient internally and more impactful externally. The <em>idea</em> of tech is often easy: “Oh, we’ll just build an app for that!” But relationships with technical service providers are fraught with pitfalls that can jeopardize outcomes and derail even the best intentions.</p>

    <p>As our <a href="https://www.dai.com/news/dai-launches-the-center-for-digital-acceleration">Center for Digital Acceleration</a> team grows, we are finding new ways to share knowledge beyond our epic WhatsApp group chat that grows more ridiculous and off-topic by the day. We have some voracious readers on the team, so in prep for this post I took a minute to poll them to find out which recent articles they found fascinating—and I had missed them all! Since I can’t be the only one, I am sharing them with you to ensure these gems get as wide a readership as possible.</p>

    <p><em>This article is part 1 of 2, as we explore the basics of importing and analyzing data in RStudio.</em></p>

<p>As a data scientist, I spend a lot of my time working in a programming language called R. RStudio is an open source integrated development environment (IDE) for the R programming language, which focuses on programming for statistical analysis. You could arguably do data analysis in almost any computer programming language, but R offers some of the most accessible statistical functions of any language available today. You could also do this work in a business intelligence application such as Tableau or PowerBI, or conduct statistical analysis in STATA, but R and RStudio are free and open source. In this post, I’m going to introduce a few lines of code to get you started on your journey into R.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.switchpointideas.com/2018">SwitchPoint 2018</a> was an inspiring, passionate, and delightful indulgence: Spending two days in lush Saxapahaw, North Carolina, <a href="http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/global-health-and-tech-thinkers-come-together-at-switchpoint/">thinking about big ideas</a> and learning from leading experts in small group sessions in between performance art and live music shows felt like such a departure from Conference As Usual. I felt space opening up in my brain to start really processing what the speakers were saying—the real act and action of listening versus the usual ruse of secretly responding to emails on my phone while half paying attention and nodding at key pauses.</p>

    <p>Last month, I spent two weeks in Malawi trying to gain a real understanding of technology use and media consumption habits of people in rural and marginalised communities. Along with a team of enumerators, I spoke to 183 women, men, girls and boys (ages 14 to 80) in different traditional authorities (TAs) in Northern, Central and Southern Malawi.</p>

    <p>As discussed in Part 1 of this two-part post on blockchain, “<a href="/blockchain-for-development-part-1-understanding-the-tech.html">Understanding the Tech</a>,” the blockchain hype is pervasive in international development these days. It is my view that blockchain does not deserve the “Swiss army knife of new technology” label that has been thrust upon it. While blockchain is exciting and potentially very useful, appropriate application of the tech can be evasive. If you need a quick and simple run down of blockchain, check out <a href="/blockchain-for-development-part-1-understanding-the-tech.html">Part 1</a>. Here I will give you a glimpse of some of the potential uses for blockchain in global development programming, and some of the challenges.</p>

    <p>Bitcoin has launched the term “blockchain” into the world’s tech vernacular. Unfortunately for blockchain as a technology and a theory, it is often, for better or worse, synonymized with Bitcoin. Because of this, the ideas of public, transparent, and unchangeable information immediately come to mind as soon as someone mentions blockchain. While this is true for Bitcoin, this is not necessarily the case for all blockchains.</p>

    <p>As the world becomes more urbanized, data on cities and the residents who inhabit them is key to building and governing sustainable communities. Yet this data is simply not available for many rural and urban areas around the world. Many cities lack base data sets—such as accurate maps of their cities that identify key infrastructure, services, and human settlements. In some cases, these maps exist on paper, but in other cases, are only available in closed, proprietary systems or not at all. This was the case in the Liberian cities of Ganta, Gbarnga, and Zwedru.</p>

Preparing for this presentation gave me a chance to reflect on the past year—the progress we have made, the challenges we have encountered, and the future of digital health in Haiti.</p>

    <p>On March 9, I moderated a workshop called “How to Engage and Support Local Innovators” at the USAID <a href="http://www.digitaldevelopment.org/digital-development-forum-2018">Digital Development Forum</a>. I was joined by three expert panelists: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielle-dhillon-a82a9859/">Danielle Dhillon</a> from the Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) at the UN Foundation; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonieliasz/">Toni Eliasz</a> from the World Bank’s Digital Entrepreneurship Program; and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tylerradford/">Tyler Radford</a> from the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT). All three are focused on nurturing local technologists and innovators. Toni and Danielle support local startup ecosystems and Tyler builds communities of volunteer mappers. What have they learned through these efforts?</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/mozambique-democratic-governance-support-programme-dgsp">Mozambique Democratic Governance Programme</a>, DIÁLOGO, funded by the U.K. Department for International Development, worked with citizens, civil society, local media, and municipal government to engage more effectively on local issues. DIÁLOGO supported innovative solutions, including mobile- and web-based technologies, to amplify the voices of citizens and help governments respond to their demands. The programme ran from 2012 in the five urban municipalities of Beira, Maputo, Nampula, Quelimane, and Tete, and ended last December.</p>

    <p>Last month, the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) launched its much-anticipated <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfid-digital-strategy-2018-to-2020-doing-development-in-a-digital-world">Digital Strategy 2018-2020: Doing Development in a Digital World</a>, outlining its vision and approach towards using technology to have a bigger, faster, and more cost-effective impact on the lives of poor people—particularly those who are marginalised.</p>

    <p>Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), commonly referred to as blockchain applications, are possibly the most talked about innovation of the day. And the most commonly discussed DLT applications are those that involve financial transactions with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency">cryptocurrencies</a>. <em>Fortune Magazine</em> <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/12/26/4-technology-trends-2018/">recently listed</a> “The Fintech Renaissance” as the second-most important technology trend of 2018, and with good reason. Last month Bitcoin saw more than <a href="https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?timespan=all">400,000 transactions</a> per day. Despite warnings of Bitcoin’s volatility, the increased investment in cryptocurrencies is hard to ignore.</p>

<p>But what about all of the other promises of DLTs? There are no shortage of articles written about their impact on data security, the value of smart contracts to create efficient online transactions, and the value of data democratization and transparency through shared ledgers. While there are case studies for each of these promising areas, distributed application developers are in short supply, and active implementations for global development projects are rare. As a result, I get the sense that blockchain may be entering the peak if its hype cycle.</p>

    <p>Recently while on assignment in Haiti, a project manager for a local agricultural development project asked my team why we weren’t targeting certain rural communities. According to him, those communities are the ones that could really benefit from the type of work we were doing. While we had good reason to work where we were working, the question stuck: <strong><em>How can we be certain that we are targeting the right communities?</em></strong></p>

    <p>Here’s the good news: Over the past 10 years the digital health community has begun to heal from a severe case of pilotitis. As a community of innovators and health systems researchers, we increasingly recognize that creating and testing new digital health tools in the absence of investments in the enabling ecosystem is likely to produce limited, short-term, and small-scale impact. Without concerted efforts to fertilize the soil in which the seeds of innovation are planted, those seeds will never mature beyond a sapling. That is, unless we pay attention to the policy and regulatory environment, the telecommunications and electrical infrastructure, and most importantly, the availability of trained and appropriate human resources to facilitate scale-up and sustainability, we cannot expect national-scale digital health projects to thrive.</p>

    <p>The new year provides a great opportunity to think about priorities for year ahead. Last week we wrote a post highlighting the top <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/digital-at-dai-year-in-review-top-ten-posts-of-2017.html">posts</a> of 2017. The most-read articles covered a lot of ground—from reflections on specific projects, to advances in our thinking on best practices for human-centered design (HCD), to technology reviews. So, what’s on our minds for the year to come?</p>

    <p>This year Digital@DAI published more than 120 posts, covering everything from our work in human-centered design (HCD) to advances in remote sensing.</p>

<p>We featured digital experts from organizations such as Panoply, BanQu, Omelas, and Bamba, and had almost 40,000 page views. We continue to explore the potential of digital technology across sectors, geographies, clients, and constituents in the blog and in the work that we do.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/digital-at-dai-year-in-review-reader-top-five-posts-of-2016.html">final blog</a> of 2016 we reviewed the top five most read articles of the year. With our audience and total number of blog posts expanding, we’ll look at our top 10 of 2017, which showcase a broad range of topics, content, and writers.</p>

    <p>Back in late 2015, I landed a unique design gig. The job came via <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/guatemala-nexos-locales">Nexos Locales</a>, a USAID-funded, DAI-run project that works with municipalities around the Western Highlands of Guatemala to improve public financial management and citizen engagement. A newly elected mayor in the municipality of Chiantla wanted to open his finances to the public to close the space for corruption, and I was asked by the project to scope out the activity.</p>

    <p>Welcome to GeekFest 2017, a series of interviews featuring ICT4D thought leaders. Our goals for our #geekfest2017 interviews are 1. to highlight the people and organizations who are pushing the field in new directions, 2. feature their work and show how it’s different or new, and 3. to support the overall growth of the ICT4D community.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Cassandra%20Mickish%20Gross%20Headshot.jpg" alt="Cassandra Mickish Gross Headshot.jpg" class="float-right" />
This week I’m speaking with <a href="https://www.k4health.org/blog/authors/cassandra-mickish">Cassandra Mickish Gross</a> from the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs to discuss the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded <a href="https://www.k4health.org/">Knowledge for Health Project</a>. In this post Cassandra reflects on her experience developing a digital health platform. We explore the choice between an established solution with the potential to scale, versus one that has clear evidence of impact on health outcomes. During the interview, she reflects on the <a href="https://www.k4health.org/projects/sub-saharan-africa">Faster to Zero Initiative</a>, implemented in partnership with <a href="http://healthenabled.org/wordpress/">HealthEnabled</a>, that aims to support the Ministries of Health of South Africa and Uganda in the scale-up of digital health tools and accelerate the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.</p>

    <p>FHI360 recently hosted its annual Technology for Resilience workshop in Bangkok. In doing so, conference organizers created an opportunity for technologists and development practitioners to learn from active technology projects that promote community resilience, and work together on innovative solutions to what are often seen as intractable problems. In this post, I’ll look at some of the technologies showcased during the conference. But before doing so, let’s define resilience.</p>

    <p>Raise your hand if you have experienced online harassment. I am sure the response is a virtual flurry. Although digital technologies have the ability to empower, connect, and liberalise, they can also serve as platforms for marginalisation and abuse.</p>

    <p>In the field of international development, human-centered designers (HCD) are charged with rapidly developing empathy with a specific, targeted, marginalized population, diving into a social challenge which that group faces, and parlaying that understanding and access into a locally-tailored solution.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/headphones.jpg" alt="headphones.jpg" /></p>

<p>Doing so successfully requires one primary skill: <strong>listening.</strong> That means listening in the traditional sense: to an individual, as DAI does in our <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/rwanda-digital-insights.html">Digital Insights</a> work. But, more broadly, listening for design in the international development space means listening to an entire population to identify social challenges as well as the cultural, political, and economic dynamics that affect them and perpetuate the problem.</p>

    <p>In late September, I traveled to Haiti to conduct research on how Haitians engage with financial institutions and mobile technology to explore the feasibility of introducing mobile money as an avenue for the provision of financial services. Together with the team from the <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/haiti-finance-inclusive-fininc">USAID/Haiti Finance Inclusive project</a>, implemented by DAI, and with support from our sister USAID/Haiti project Finance Pour Tous and two key credit unions—<a href="https://www.facebook.com/CPFRATERNITE/">Caisse Populaire Fraternite (CPF)</a> and Socolavim—I visited nine locations through the northern and central provinces of the country to interview 181 credit union customers as they went about their business.</p>

    <p>I distinctly remember an early conversation with colleagues when I began working in digital development in which a peer dismissively waved his hand at the idea of implementing a live data dashboard, saying “A dashboard is a dashboard is a dashboard!” The finality of that line stuck with me. I assumed that the dismissal came from a person who was bored with dashboards, like a kid who opens a birthday present to find he has received yet ANOTHER dashboard. Well, interactive data dashboards—just like automobile dashboards—may not be the newest, hottest, shiniest thing in the ICT4D toolbox, but they’re still important and their often hidden values go unappreciated by many.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.development-innovations.org/">Development Innovations</a> supports innovators and boosts the use of information and communication technologies for the overall development of Cambodia. The project is structured to be flexible and adaptive—because we need to. Really, most creative development programs <em>should</em> build themselves to be learning organizations, to be ready for big pivots, regardless if you and your partners use digital innovations. The development world is regularly disrupted—by political changes, natural disasters, new technologies such as social media—and is no longer built for static, five-year plans. Donors and funders need partners that can learn by doing, and are not afraid to adapt strategies and implementation plans to continually improve.</p>

Welcome to GeekFest 2017, a series of interviews featuring ICT4D thought leaders. Our goals for #geekfest2017 are: to highlight the people and organizations who are pushing the field in new directions, to feature their work and show how it’s different or new, and to support the overall growth of the ICT4D community.</p>

<p>This week we are focusing on public access as a solution to closing the Digital Divide. Being able to access free public wifi can be crucial for those who cannot afford internet subscriptions: It can be the difference between finally finding that job, getting the training you need or linking up with a valuable investor for your new venture. The <a href="http://a4ai.org/affordability-report/report/2017/">2017 A4AI  Affordability Report</a> noted the importance of public wifi for engendering use of the internet: Research shows public wifi as one of the most popular options for online access.</p>

<p>We sat down with Duduzile Mkhwanazi, CEO of <a href="http://www.projectisizwe.org/">Project Isizwe</a>-an organization making great strides in providing free public wifi in South Africa, a country where inequality is rife and the affordability of mobile data is just out of reach for many, despite <a href="http://www.mobileconnectivityindex.com/#year=2016&amp;zoneIsocode=ZAF">99 percent 3G coverage</a>.</p>

    <p>This past week USAID’s Global Development Lab and mStar project released the <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/15396/Gender_and_ICT_Toolkit.pdf">Gender and ICT Survey Toolkit</a>. In an informative webinar (you can listen to the recording <a href="http://solutionscenter.nethope.org/webinars/view/introducing-usaids-gender-and-ict-toolkit">here</a>), the team that produced the report discussed both the content and the context surrounding the genesis of the toolkit. I tuned in and spent the majority of the time silently cheering, thrilled to hear USAID promoting research tactics and information needs that align with what we on DAI’s ICT team are doing with our <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=digital-insights">Digital Insights</a> work. In between cheers, I feverishly took notes and captured these three key takeaways.</p>

    <p>Primary data collection: One of the most challenging, but necessary, components of any research project. Mobile and browser-based technologies have revolutionized the speed and efficiency of collecting data, enabling teams to work together on a centralized database without the headache of managing paper forms, or multiple excel documents.</p>

<p>If you’re reading this article, it’s likely you’ve used <a href="https://www.google.com/forms/about/">Googleforms</a> or <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/">Survey Monkey</a> for your work. But what if you need to collect data in regions without 3G or LTE coverage? You’ll need a tool to manage offline data collection, and load the data once you access a wireless internet connection. Fortunately, there are several tools designed to do just that, and one of them is completely free and open source. It’s called <a href="https://opendatakit.org/">OpenDataKit</a> (ODK). Let’s take a look at how this technology works.</p>

    <p>When we do “open innovation,” it’s essential to define the problem we are trying to solve. And crucial to that process is crafting a good “Call.”  Can this be done in 60 minutes or less?</p>

    <p>Any honest digital designer will admit it: Most tech tools fail. At least the first time around. Getting your users to drop the old way of doing things and use your new website (or gadget, or app) isn’t easy. It doesn’t matter if it visualizes their transactions in some really clever way, or sends their user data to the cloud for real-time analysis, or even if it saves them time or money. Behavior change is difficult, and doubly so when you’re designing across cultures. Why? A few reasons:</p>

    <p>Expanding internet access in ‘last-mile markets’ is a priority for development agencies—and rightly so. The economic costs to countries that do not offer their populations internet access is high: <a href="https://www.canback.com/files/2014_Offline_and_falling_behind_Barriers_to_Internet_adoption.pdf">Studies</a> have detailed the internet’s macroeconomic boost to GDP, the economic and employment benefits of the growth in the digital sector, and the impact of ICT on small business revenue and job creation. Internet access has also been shown to <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2016">improve learning and health</a> outcomes and <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ie/Documents/TechnologyMediaCommunications/2014_uk_tmt_value_of_connectivity_deloitte_ireland.pdf">catalyze civic engagement</a>. Reading these reports, it seems we’re in an all-hands-on-deck moment to get bandwidth into every last corner of the earth. But what about the risks?</p>

After reading the <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=data-management-series">previous two posts in this series</a>, you’ve come a long way: you’ve devised a brilliant monitoring, evaluation, and learning plan, set up your data storage and management infrastructure, and conducted your baseline data collection. It’s finally time to get to the good stuff and dive into the data to make sense of it all—with eye-popping graphics worth of downtown billboards!</p>

    <p>So, after reading <a href="/data-management-series-planning-and-collecting-part-1.html">last week’s blog</a>, you’ve developed the world’s most robust monitoring, evaluation, and learning plan. You just conducted a multi-tier baseline assessment, validating your data by triangulating data points through five different surveying tools and are excited to dig in to multivariate regression analysis. But wait! First we need to talk about data storage and management!</p>

<p>In the international development world, an all-too-familiar sight is binders of data sitting idly on shelves in rural government offices. We all acknowledge that there are much better ways to store and maintain our results. However, many organizations only move one or two steps up the ladder: from paper and pen to .xlsx or .csv files on a laptop. While this may enable you to conduct the minimum analysis needed to satisfy your donor in an annual report, does it really maximize the value of the data we collect?</p>

    <p>If you’ve been paying any attention to the so-called data revolution, you may have heard the expression “Data is the new oil.” The phrase has been attributed to and adopted by countless people and organizations to whom the central reasoning is clear: In the information age, data is an incredibly valuable “commodity.” The purpose of the analogy as originally made by mathematician Clive Humby in 2006 is significantly deeper though. He said that data is valuable, but cannot be used if it is unrefined. Like oil, data has to be changed, transformed, broken down, and analyzed for us to actually draw out the value locked within. This is true for anyone producing or accessing any type of raw datasets, including development organizations.</p>

    <p>One of the largest barriers to improving health outcomes across the world is the difficulty of changing behaviors. Building a stable health system that provides quality products and services to its beneficiaries can only go as far as the patients’ willingness to trust that system. There may be clinical evidence that proves the health benefits of a given drug or device, but can that evidence compete with history, cultural norms, stigma, trust, and many more behavioral and societal pressures that often preclude widescale adoption?</p>

    <p>Here at DAI we rely on software applications and data systems for our everyday work. From internal chat applications, to business intelligence software, to online data collection platforms, technology systems enable us to do our work more efficiently and effectively. But when working on international development projects, we must consider other factors such as access to desktop versus mobile devices, computer processing power and storage, levels of technical acumen, and maybe most importantly, cost.</p>

<p>More than 800,000 refugees came to the Island of Lesvos, Greece, to seek safety and a new life. Many of them came from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and other conflict-ridden countries. As the refugee crisis in Greece subsided, there are about 3,000 refugees who now remain there, anxious to find ways to integrate and contribute to Greek society. The refugees I met are educated and skilled and some used to run their own businesses. They’re not helpless, but they are constrained and in a state of limbo as they await asylum. This state of uncertainty and despair is especially challenging for refugees who were, until recently, productive members of the workforce. Our role is to help them understand their new pathway, by leveraging what they already know to do as well as provide new skills.</p>

<p>One of them is Jalal. He is just 22 and full of energy and aspirations. Jalal is building his own social enterprise to help fellow refugees and working as a translator at a local law firm. He even taught himself English during his stay in Greece by interacting with international volunteers and other aid workers. Is Jalal unique? Are there more budding entrepreneurs like him? Can we help them achieve their dreams?</p>

<p>Welcome to <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=geekfest-2017">GeekFest 2017</a>, a series of interviews featuring ICT4D thought leaders. Our goals for #GeekFest2017 are: to highlight the people and organizations who are pushing the field in new directions, to feature their work and show how it’s different or new, and to support the overall growth of the ICT4D community.</p>

<p>This week I’m speaking to <a href="http://www.jessica.berlin">Jessica Berlin</a>, the co-founder of the <a href="http://www.makernet.global">MakerNet Consortium</a> and founder and Managing Director of <a href="http://www.costruct.co">CoStruct</a> based in—you guessed it—Berlin, Germany. Before taking the leap as an entrepreneur, Jessica worked for a number of German and U.S. government organizations and development agencies as well as nonprofits in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America—experiences that inspired her to start her own company to create new programs, provide innovation strategy consulting, and build public-private partnerships to advance business and tech innovation in emerging economies.</p>

<p>Development organizations now have a <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/mobile-data-collection-a-sector-in-flux.html">plethora </a>of mobile data collection tools at their disposal, and choosing between the various options available can often seem like a daunting task. But even after finding the right tool, it is imperative to think through and address the most common challenges that arise in the mobile data collection process. In the last five years of helping development actors integrate mobile phones into their data collection processes, we’ve identified five challenges they run into most often.</p>

<p>My colleague pressed $1,000 in visibly fake Nepali rupees into the hands of each farmer, inputs dealer, and agricultural entrepreneur.   Then, she grandly opened the doors to our ersatz <em>haat</em> bazaar (an outdoor, rural marketplace) and instructed them to, “Pay what you would be willing to spend on the products.”</p>

<p>For two hours, the din associated with an actual marketplace poured out of a Kathmandu conference room. The Data-Driven Farming Prize’s 13 finalist teams became sellers straining to attract prospective buyers from among the invited participants. But how did data analysts, graduate students, and entrepreneurs transform into wily hawkers? Why was a simulated haat bazaar a Data-Driven Farming Prize activity?</p>

    <p>Bilateral donors and foundations continue to look to digital tools to innovate. Why innovate? Given the intractable nature of many development problems, innovation speaks to the desire for different results, to try something new, or to apply something old in a new context or in a new way. Digital tools hold the promise that a program can leapfrog traditional development pathways, amplify impact, and create real game-changers in people’s lives. One way to increase the possibility of success in deploying any digital tool is to follow the principles for digital design - particularly design with the user. Human-centered design (HCD), and its close cousins, co-creation, design thinking, and lean startup methods, can serve not just as an activity but as a process for effective creation, iteration, and implementation.</p>

    <p>On the ICT team we wear many hats and have many responsibilities. We are technical specialists who support our company’s global development projects in the design and use of digital solutions. We are evangelists who teach others about the potential of digital technologies to enhance and sustain the impact of development programming. We are thought leaders who answer strategic questions about where digital development is as a technical field and where it might be going. These are the aspects of our work that often appear in our blog posts.</p>

<p>But another hat we wear is as trainers: It is our responsibility to familiarize our projects and clients with the fundamentals of digital design and to equip colleagues with practical knowledge on how to effectively integrate digital programming into their work so they can design and deliver their own digital programs. Since joining the team some 19 months ago, I have had the chance to train 100+ people in three countries on the fundamentals of digital development. Below are my biggest takeaways on how to ensure that participants get the most out of their training.</p>

    <p>Civil society organizations (CSOs) play a critical role in public life: understanding citizens’ daily challenges, providing services to address those challenges in the short-term, and pursuing long-term policy solutions. In Cambodia, there are hundreds of CSOs, but a wide variability in management capacity, technical capability, and staffing has given rise to domestic and international organizations that exist to help these CSOs carry out their important social role more effectively.</p>

<p>Domestically, the <a href="http://www.ccc-cambodia.org/">Cooperation Committee for Cambodia</a> (CCC) functions as a membership association for Cambodian civil society organizations, and provides training, research, and technical assistance to roughly 170 member organizations. From the international community, there is a wide range of donors, foundations, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that support Cambodian CSOs, including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DevInnoKH/">USAID’s Development Innovations (DI)</a> project. DI helps local CSOs, technology companies, and social enterprises design and use new technologies to address Cambodia’s development challenges.</p>

    <p>In the typical way things happen at large global firms with highly decentralized project management, I first learned about the exceptional digital work being done by DAI’s U.S. Agency for International Development-funded <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/uzbekistan-usaid-agricultural-value-chain-activity-uzbekistan-uzbekistan-avc">Agricultural Value Chain Activity in Uzbekistan project</a> (AVC) through an email referenced in a meeting about something totally different. I took a photo of the email—true story, I even sent the shot to my colleagues I was so excited—followed up with the listed contacts, and two weeks later was  having a fascinating conversation with two dynamic Uzbek colleagues, Kamil Yakubov and Sardor Kadirov, who manage AVC’s digital initiatives.</p>

    <p><em>This is our latest piece on <a href="http://www.kosmosinnovationcenter.com/">Kosmos Innovation Center (KIC)</a>, a DAI-supported initiative that helps young entrepreneurs build tech startups that address challenges in Ghana’s agricultural industry. Find out more about this project in previous Digital@DAI posts <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/ghana-agritech-exchange.html">here </a>and <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/ict-in-the-agricultural-sector-business-concepts-from-ghanaian-youth.html">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>The KIC works at the intersection of three fields traditionally dominated by men: agriculture, entrepreneurship, and technology. In response, the KIC is tapping into the potential of young female entrepreneurs. Below we profile some of the women co-founders playing a key role in developing business concepts, designing technology products, and pitching to potential investors.</p>

    <p>More than 17,000 Washington, D.C.-area residents are commuting by bicycle today, as part of the 17th annual <a href="https://www.biketoworkmetrodc.org/">Bike to Work Day</a>. The event’s rising popularity parallels the region’s growing investment in bicycle infrastructure and multimodal transportation. This is a positive trend, particularly for those of us who want cities and urban areas to provide safe, convenient, and diverse transportation options for all residents. But is there a larger message for international development? What can Bike to Work Day tell us about the importance of open data for civic engagement?</p>

    <p>Working on an ICT team can sometimes feel like being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheus_(The_Matrix)">Morpheus</a> of the development world—all we want to do is show development project teams that digital tools can unleash immense potential. So we try our best to sneak ICT elements into projects in any way possible: short blurbs in project proposals, ICT strategy documents while on technical assignments in the field, or straight-up bribery. Whatever it takes to sugarcoat the red pill. So imagine our surprise when we were asked to meet with a DAI-led project that <em>already</em> has multiple ICT tools integrated into its workflow: the  Kenya <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/kenya-hunger-safety-net-programme-phase-2-hsnp2">Hunger Safety Net Programme Phase 2 (HSNP2)</a>, funded by the U.K. Department for International Development.</p>

<p>Welcome to GeekFest 2017, a series of interviews featuring ICT4D thought leaders. Our goals for #geekfest2017 are: to highlight the people and organizations who are pushing the field in new directions, to feature their work and show how it’s different or new, and to support the overall growth of the ICT4D community.</p>

<p>In this installment, I’m picking the brain of my own sister, Yasmin Bin-Humam, a Financial Sector Specialist at the World Bank Consultative Group to Assist the Poor. Yasmin is establishing a community of practice focusing on solutions to improve women’s access to financial services, such as mobile and digital services.</p>

    <p>F8, <a href="https://www.fbf8.com/">Facebook’s annual conference</a>, was my first trip to Silicon Valley—I’ve been to the Silicon Wadi in Israel and the Silicon Savannah in Kenya, but never had I stepped foot where it all began. It was the perfect sort of baptism by fire into the ethos of the place that brought us semiconductors, personal computing and smartphones: a gathering where the future is dreamed up by developers and defined by technology’s limitless potential. It was wild.</p>

<p>I’ll outline below a few of the innovations that are particularly relevant to the work we do, and then make an argument for why the practice of ICT4D is more important than ever.</p>

    <p>We love remote sensing here at DAI and luckily for us, satellite imagery APIs are starting to pop up all over, like springtime flowers. One of the most prominent imagery providers is <a href="https://www.planet.com/">Planet</a>, a small company with lofty service and product offerings for remote sensing. Planet builds and launches small satellites that image the entire world every day. It provides access to that imagery through a web platform, and it gives developers access to its data through a web API.</p>

<p>In December 2016, I spent a month in Honduras helping launch the new <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/honduras-local-governance-activity-hlg">USAID Local Governance Activity</a> and, replicating some work I did in <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/innovation-and-entrepreneurship-in-el-salvador.html">El Salvador</a> last year, I decided to get to know the innovation and technology community. Why?</p>

<p>DAI is currently launching <em>four</em> new USAID-funded projects in Honduras: local governance, a <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/honduras-justice-human-rights-and-security-strengthening-activity-jhrss">justice &amp; human rights project</a>, <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/honduras-ProParque-GEMA">an environmental governance project</a>, and the new <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/honduras-school-based-violence-prevention-activity-sbvpa">school-based violence prevention</a> project. My goal in writing this piece is the same as it was when I wrote <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/hey-usaid-want-to-promote-innovation.html">Hey USAID, Want to Promote Innovation?</a>: to get those new projects to think creatively about how to achieve their goals.</p>

So, in the spirit of investigative journalism, we sent one of our staff members to India to find out more.</p>

    <p>It’s late January in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which means I’ve managed to avoid the usual heat and humidity, but the bustle and throng are just what I’d expect of one of South Asia’s largest cities. Even though I grew up in India, I’ve never had the chance to travel to its sister republic to the east. And yet, all at once, everything seems familiar—the cars, the noise, the smells. My guide through the city is Ontiq Dey, an eager young graduate student of economics and a seasoned data collector. He and four of his classmates are DAI’s street team for our first-ever <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=digital-insights">Digital Insights</a> study in South Asia.</p>

    <p>We’re pleased to launch a new research product on the blog today: <strong>Ecosystem Insights</strong> (EI). EI seeks to understand <em>how key groups of stakeholders use digital tools to connect with each other and share information</em>, pushing beyond the individual personas of our <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=digital-insights">Digital Insights</a> work to gain insights into how groups access and use ICT in both their personal and professional lives. We conducted this research alongside our partner <a href="http://www.cipe.org/">CIPE</a>’s star provincial teams in Herat, Kandahar, Balkh, and Nangarhar. Not surprisingly, even in rural Afghanistan, smartphone and social media penetration rates are <em>much</em> higher than currently published reports account for. These findings continue to prove that DAI’s investment in this research is worthwhile: Designing a sustainable and high-impact ICT intervention will always start with knowing the what, how, and why of users’ ICT habits.</p>

<p>Back in the day, when I was but a young ICT4D practitioner trying to figure out how to get hundreds of thousands of Somalis to open and read text messages about democracy and governance from a tiny startup’s office in Palestine, I developed a weird habit of obsessively reading fast-moving consumer good product mobile marketing blogs. Why? These commercially focused blogs had super insightful guidance on how to structure mobile campaigns and get users to open, read, and act upon messaging content—because at the end of the day, selling good governance isn’t that different from selling individual shampoo packets. Both take targeted, entertaining and value-added content, and timing to have the most impact, and because the advertising firms servicing large multinationals had a lot more money to invest in getting the art of the mobile campaign right, I figured, why not poach their best practices for the social sector? Fast forward seven years, and I’m doing the same thing but for Facebook.</p>

    <p>When I first heard that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/12/agents-on-messenger/">Facebook Messenger was introducing</a> chatbots, I immediately thought back to junior high summers. Back then I was spending a lot of time in my parents’ basement on the computer–safe from harmful things like sunshine and other people–getting into flame wars with people on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> that (more often than not) turned out to be chatbots. Not my greatest summer. Fast forward some 20 years, and chatbots are back with a vengence, this time with a significantly improved value proposition: (near) last mile access to native language information and services.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=digital-insights">Digital Insights</a> research in <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/where-whatsapp-is-just-another-bbm-clone-digital-insights-indonesia.html">Indonesia</a>, <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/mobiles-in-central-america-digital-insights-honduras-part-2.html">Honduras</a>, and <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/consumer-insights-palestine-e-governance-readiness.html">Palestine</a> emphasized the popularity of Facebook and FB Messenger in the marginalized communities where DAI and other development implementers work. In Indonesia, 77 percent of the people we interviewed said they use Facebook on their phones; in Palestine that number was <strong>95 percent</strong>. In Honduras, 80 percent of our respondents across urban and rural areas said they use Facebook. If development projects want to reach people with information and services, we must meet them on the platforms where they already spend time: in more and more cases, as access to the internet, smartphones, and social media grow, that means on Facebook. (No, not exclusively and not in all instances. read our <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/where-whatsapp-is-just-another-bbm-clone-digital-insights-indonesia.html">Indonesia post</a>, and see which social media messaging app is king there.)</p>

<p>#SatDiversity and #FatData are two hashtags I did not expect to see blaring across the screen when I attended the <a href="https://satsummit.io">SatSummit</a> conference this week. These bold declarations are something new: a compression of expression, capturing with perfect brevity the major themes of a fledgling tech space on the cusp of bringing real change almost as quickly as the terabytes of data that rain down to Earth from satellites bearing the names of these space-technology pioneers. Here’s some key takeaways from the event.</p>

    <p>The phrase “Catch-22” was originally coined to describe a paradoxical situation that someone is unable to escape from because of contradictory rules or regulations. Think, for example, about the recent graduate who is unable to obtain a job because he or she does not possess any previous work experience, yet cannot gain any work experience because he or she cannot get a job. Fortunately, as tends to be the case with graduates who persist, compromising expectations and demands, eventually someone takes a chance, giving them the benefit of the doubt, and chooses to invest in their potential.</p>

<p>You could live a perfectly fulfilled life while taking for granted all the colors that appear in the natural world. However, when you ask “why?”—a fascinating level of complexity is revealed, and this is especially true for the colors of nature: green forests, blue skies, red roses, golden sunsets.</p>

<p>Some incredible things were happening in the United States in 1972: Bill Withers’ “Lean on Me” was the No. 1 song on the radio; the first “Godfather” film was released; and NASA launched the first in a series of satellites designed to provide consistent and reliable coverage of the earth’s land cover. The platform—the Earth Resources Technology Satellite or ERTS-1—was developed in partnership with <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/">the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)</a>, which agreed to handle the storage, archiving, and distribution of the data products. The second satellite, eventually renamed Landsat 2, launched in 1975, operating in parallel with ERTS-1 for a few years until the original satellite was decommissioned in 1978.</p>

This is what marketing departments call the Internet of Things (IoT): devices that are networked for sensing, control, and/or coordination. Under the stifling blanket of hype, though, new platforms, network protocols, and data repositories really are enabling applications of value, in addition to the tweeting kitchen appliances which, one hopes, will stay in Vegas.</p>

<p>Welcome to Geekfest 2017, a series of interviews featuring ICT4D thought leaders. Our goals in launching #geekfest2017 are: to highlight the people and organizations who are pushing the field in new directions, to feature their work and show how it’s different or new, and to support the growth of the ICT4D community.</p>

<p>We’re kicking things off with <a href="https://developmentseed.org/team/ian-schuler/">Ian Schuler</a>, the CEO of <a href="https://www.developmentseed.org/">Development Seed</a>, one of the lead organizers and sponsors for the upcoming <a href="https://satsummit.io/">SatSummit</a>.</p>

    <p>Kabul, 2016. I’d been here before: a cold cup of Nescafe and stack of overly formatted CVs on the table next to me, an over-worked HR officer slow-blinking at me from across the room in subtle panic. Of the 35 CVs in the stack, culled from hundreds submitted online, only two had any mention of ICT experience—the rest were full of network engineering degrees, Oracle and Microsoft certifications, and years and years of experience managing IT networks and project systems. If I had been looking to hire IT staff, I would have been spoiled for options—but I wasn’t. I was trying to hire an ICT officer, and it was almost impossible. Just as it had been in Cambodia,  Jordan, and Senegal. Why, oh, why was hiring ICT staff so hard, and what could we do about it?</p>

    <p>That’s a wrap for 2016, folks. We launched this blog in February with a sense of curiosity and caution, unsure who would read it—or if it would be read at all. Since then, we’ve grown steadily to more than 2,000 page views a month, collaborated with colleagues throughout the ICT4D ecosystem to host 12 guest author posts, and had the privilege of teammate <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/authors/john-deriggi/">John DeRiggi</a> being interviewed by the BBC’s program “<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006m9ry">Click,</a>” about his post on <a href="https://dai-global-digital.com/machine-learning-will-help-development-projects-achieve-scale.html">Machine Learning in Afghanistan</a>.</p>

Alvarado had been elected on a platform of budget transparency and social audit and was part of a wave of good governance reformers that swept into office on the heels of the <a href="http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/guatemala-la-linea-customs-scandal-explained">Línea</a> corruption scandal, which saw both President Otto Perez Molina and Vice President Roxana Baldetti jailed. He wanted DAI’s help to design and develop a mobile tool to give the citizens of Chiantla (Chiantlecos) better access to municipal government. In particular, he wanted to give Chiantlecos an easy, transparent view on how his government was allocating and spending money, facilitating social audit and giving citizens the ability to more easily communicate with his administration. So, the project called me, and I called the Mayor.</p>

<p>I started my career by conducting threat analyses of suspected jihadists. I’d trawl their online profiles and then use a mix of instinct and experience to decide what to include. It made sense that sharing a post from a Taliban website signaled radicalization. It made sense that following a jihadist preacher signaled the same. It made sense that liking a Facebook page for bacon lovers signaled some apprehension about fundamentalism. But making sense was the extent of the proof we had.</p>

    <p>In recent years, mobile surveys and data collection capabilities have increased alongside rapidly expanding mobile phone penetration in the developing world. And with this trend, there has been a proliferation of small firms that have entered this space. At DAI, we realize that by allowing us to quickly capture hard-to-gather data and conduct surveys across our portfolio, new tools can change the way we execute development projects as well as win new business.</p>

    <p>I apologize for using the word “innovation” in the title of this post. I know… I work in ICT4D and I’m supposed to be a champion for innovation in all its forms. The truth is, for me, the word has nearly lost all its meaning. Innovation is easily one of the most overused and least-understood words favored by businesses, academia, and yes, international development agencies. So instead of writing a post on how we can “promote innovation,” per se, I prefer to write about how we as development practitioners can use promising models to source, finance, and apply new solutions—be they digital technologies, products, or processes—to development problems based on open competition, collaboration, and evidence.</p>

    <p>This past week I attended <a href="http://www.hesntechcon.com/">TechCon 2016</a>, co-hosted this year by MIT and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). TechCon is the annual gathering of the <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/hesn">Higher Education Solutions Network</a>, a partnership between USAID and top universities to harness the academic power, passion, and curiosity of students, researchers, and faculty to solve global development challenges. Spoiler alert: it was GREAT. It’s easy to forget in the day-in, day-out of ICT4D work that “technology” has a far broader remit than the work we as ICT4D practitioners do in it. Engaging with researchers and academics conducting research far outside my normal scope awakened a sense of real and joyful curiosity I hadn’t felt in awhile. So beyond this humble reminder, and that Boston in autumn is truly glorious, here’s a few other things I learned at TechCon.</p>

<p>One of the core functions of an effective monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system is the ability to accurately count things. Depending on your M&amp;E strategy, you may be counting the number of schools built in a district, number of boreholes functioning in a region, or the number of microloans given to farmers in a cluster of villages. From my experience designing and operationalizing M&amp;E plans for a range of private and bilaterally funded programs, counting people is by far the hardest and most complex to do—especially when you are trying to observe and record information on the same people over an extended time.</p>

    <p>In a not-so-distant past life, I was at the <a href="http://www.peacetechlab.org/technology/ptx/">PeaceTech Lab</a>, a spin-off from the <a href="https://www.usip.org/">U.S. Institute of Peace</a>. For the most part, the Lab executes in-country technology and media projects, but one vestige of its parent organization’s think tank legacy is the <a href="http://www.peacetechlab.org/data/blogs-and-bullets">Blogs &amp; Bullets</a> project—a research initiative done in partnership with some of the wonkiest political science and data analysis geeks from American University, George Washington University, and Stanford University. As I’ve made my transition into a full-time ‘do tank’ like DAI, it has become easy to dismiss (or forget) the somewhat esoteric pursuits of our friends in academia. But with the release last week of the <a href="http://www.peacetechlab.org/blogs-bullets-iv">latest installment</a> in the Blogs &amp; Bullets series, I was reminded just how important the work of the Ivory Tower is to advancing our understanding of the role of ICT in creating real world change in the places where we work.</p>
