The global community have recognised the importance of digital equality - laying out affordable, universal internet access as one of the Sustainable Development Goals. When we are implementing digital programmes, access and inclusion are key concerns: we don’t want to leave anyone behind.

The Principles for Digital Development, endorsed by a number of organisations, aim to guide practitioners in applying digital technologies to development in a way that is specific to the context or environment in which they are working. But how do we get the data to understand the ecosystem we will be working in?

Below I outline a few resources for data on digital access and inclusion, ranging from policy & regulation data, affordability stats and gender-disaggregated data. The resources are from the past couple of years and whilst the digital world moves at lightening speed, these are still valuable sources of global information.

1. A4AI Affordability Report (2017)

The Alliance for Affordable Internet “[Affordability Drivers Index](http://a4ai.org/affordability-report/data/?_year=2017&indicator=INDEX )” assesses the extent to which countries have implemented a number of factors that can lower the overall cost structure for broadband (i.e. affordability drivers). The basis for the index is to assess the different factors that can lower the overall cost structure for broadband, rather than just looking at broadband price. Countries are scored across two main policy groups, Infrastructure and Access, and ranked relatively to one another. The data has shown a correlation between this score and the price of a 1GB prepaid data plan.

The data goes back to 2014, 2016 and 2017, which allows for handy comparison. You are also able to compare the 58 countries across communications infrastructure and access, and a number of sub-factors under these. Under infrastructure, for instance, you can find out a country’s electrification rate, percentage of the population covered by the mobile cellular network, and the speed of broadband.

This is a great resource for overarching, high-level data on the connectivity ecosystem in which you are or will be working. It can provide an overview of how affordable the internet is in Nigeria, compared to other Sub-Saharan African countries, or give an insight into how poor electrification rates in Malawi could be a factor in internet uptake. However, data is not aggregated by gender, rural vs urban, or other factors and so cannot provide the detailed analysis needed to truly understand the ecosystem and design with the users in mind.
