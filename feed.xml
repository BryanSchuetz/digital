        <title>COVID-19: Looking for the Helpers in the Hardware Community</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the COVID-19 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/11/health/coronavirus-pandemic-world-health-organization/index.html&quot;&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt; makes its way across the globe, and even well-resourced health systems struggle with the availability of critical supplies needed to treat patients, initiatives have emerged in the hardware community looking to help solve the shortage of physical supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unlocking the Value of Digital Transformation in the Social Sector</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For many years, the support of international donors to civil society organizations and private and public sectors in the technology field revolved around the provision of equipment, hardware, and software. On many occasions, these types of support have proved ineffective. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261263057_Overcoming_ICT_project_failures_-_A_practical_perspective&quot;&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; wrote in 2013, these investments quickly became obsolete or abandoned. Since then, we in the digital development community have supported international donors and international programming to better integrate technology into our work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Closing the Gender Digital Divide: What We’re Doing to Bring Women Online</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Digital technologies are revolutionizing the way we access information, financing, and networks—all critical tools for fully participating in the global economy. Yet, these technologies, most notably internet connectivity and mobile phones, are not reaching all people equally. In recognition of International Women’s Day, we are looking at one of the most pressing barriers women face to their economic advancement—the gender digital divide—and how DAI is addressing this problem through the U.S. Agency for International Development’s W-GDP&lt;a href=&quot;https://womenconnectchallenge.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/newsletter_final.pdf&quot;&gt; WomenConnect Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, implemented by DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df&quot;&gt;Digital Frontiers&lt;/a&gt; project. (For the latest information, please read our most recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://womenconnectchallenge.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/newsletter_final.pdf&quot;&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What are Cyber Harms and Why Are They Important for Digital Development?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, the digital landscape has significantly changed globally. First, and most obvious, the number of internet users has nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/273018/number-of-internet-users-worldwide/&quot;&gt;doubled&lt;/a&gt; from 2.8 billion to more than 4 billion in the last six years. Second, and perhaps a bit less obvious, the number of cyber incidents, such as data breaches or cybercrimes, impacting the average internet user, has grown exponentially. For a while now, I’ve been thinking about what these cybersecurity trends mean for our work in digital development. I recently read an article that helped frame the challenge in a way that is easily digestible, even by the least digitally focused development expert.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using Social Media to Build Community (and Advance Project Goals)—Tips and Tricks from Development Innovations</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For those of us who follow the tech world, big tech has &lt;a href=&quot;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/what-its-like-to-own-an-amazon-ring-doorbell-camera.html&quot;&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126970/apple-iphone-independent-repair-contract-search-audit&quot;&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/6ec3f6a6-4d56-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-why-facebook-agreed-to-pay-550-million-privacy-settlement-to-illinois-2020-02-09&quot;&gt;press&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/microsoft-accidentally-exposed-250-million-customer-support-records-online-heres-what-you-should-know.html&quot;&gt;lately&lt;/a&gt;. Even development practitioners have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ictworks.org/facebook-digital-development/#.Xkq6_ihKg2y&quot;&gt;getting in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.devex.com/news/what-the-facebook-scandal-means-for-data-for-good-92425&quot;&gt;on the game&lt;/a&gt;. However, I like to keep things interesting—so here is a positive story about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; helping catalyze a community of innovators in Cambodia on the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.development-innovations.org/&quot;&gt;Development Innovations (DI)&lt;/a&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What's the Best Architecture for a Management Information System?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I hate to say it, but it depends. Generally though, I do have an opinion, and while your mileage may vary, I think one model might often better serve more use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, you might think our products team only builds full-stack web applications. That is only half our story. We also spend a significant time providing technical advice to DAI project staff and their government counterparts on the technology solutions they are looking to procure. I call this &lt;em&gt;translating:&lt;/em&gt; taking the needs and requirements of the project and explaining it in technical terms to developers and IT experts. One common area we help project staff understand, update, or integrate is a management information system (MIS) in disparate and un-harmonized contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What the Food Systems Dashboard Taught Me About Data for Decision Making</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I began working with DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration, I have had the chance to explore many of the exciting opportunities presented by our quickly digitizing world. Though I spend most of my time researching how digital tools and service platforms impact economic empowerment and productivity in the agriculture sector, an area that I am eager to explore further is the role of data in policy and decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Development in the Western Balkans: Kosovo</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month, the talented, globe-trotting &lt;a href=&quot;http://dai-global-digital.com/authors/chloe-messenger/&quot;&gt;Chloe Messenger&lt;/a&gt; posted the first &lt;a href=&quot;http://dai-global-digital.com/digital-development-in-the-western-balkans-bosnia-and-herzegovina.html&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; on DAI’s activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina in our six-part series about digital development in the Western Balkans. If you haven’t read it, you should. If you did, you’ll know that the United Kingdom’s Foreign Commonwealth Office (FCO) funded DAI to map digital ecosystems across the Western Balkans, with a focus on identifying areas where the FCO can support the technology sector in closing the digital skill supply-demand gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina, check. Next up—Kosovo!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Citizen-Centered Governance App Launches in Kabul</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This follows an earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/citizen-centered-design-and-frontier-insights-in-kabul-municipality.html&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; that covers our pre-development human-centered design (HCD) phase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Kabul residents have lamented the hours-long queue to access services at their municipal office. Several weeks ago, Kabul Municipality’s solution was hard to ignore. News of a new citizen engagement app was seen displayed on 21 billboards throughout the city, broadcast on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqLA8GD-33I&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;local television&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.outlookafghanistan.net/national_detail.php?post_id=25808&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; sites, shared on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/KabulMunicipality/posts/2194828510813555&quot;&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;, and proudly showcased by the Mayor of Kabul at a launch event that drew 250 attendees and local media.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>6 Ways Innovation and Entrepreneurship Promote Prosperity</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is not a coincidence that the most developed nations are also the ones with the highest levels of entrepreneurial &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/economic-development-innovation-and-entrepreneurship_b_593167b7e4b00573ab57a28b&quot;&gt;activity and innovation&lt;/a&gt;. While starting from a minimal level of development helps the latter two, for example, through basic access to capital and institutional stability, the impact of innovation and entrepreneurship on the economy and society more broadly cannot be overstated. In fact, the impact goes beyond usual suspects such as increased productivity, competitiveness, and job creation, and spills over into areas as diverse as regulation, infrastructure, the environment, and social inclusion. Below I provide a (certainly nonexhaustive) list of six such effects. While every issue deserves an article (or even a book!) of its own, these are brief overviews of each point.&lt;/p&gt;
