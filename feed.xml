        <title>Can Rural Digital Community Centers Be Sustainable?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog first appeared in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ictworks.org/digital-community-centers-sustainable/&quot;&gt;ICT Works&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bridge the digital divide, digital community centers—physical spaces that provide access to the internet, technology devices, and digital skills—have become a popular solution for organizations working to bring connectivity to remote areas. Not only do these centers bring internet access to previously unconnected communities, but they also deliver digital literacy training to equip citizens with the skills and knowledge to use technology for personal and economic growth while ensuring their meaningful and safe use of it. While these centers may benefit their communities and act as gateways to the digital world, a pressing question lingers: Can these centers become truly sustainable and self-sufficient?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we explore the lessons learned by digital community centers established under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/usaid-microsoft-airband-initiative&quot;&gt;USAID/Microsoft Airband Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, a public-private partnership that seeks to bring internet access to more women around the world. Partners of the initiative, including internet service providers (ISPs) and technology companies, have built and managed these centers in rural and semi-urban areas and pursued different models for sustainability. We’ll delve into the approaches the partners have pursued to keep community center doors open once initial financial support from the U.S. Agency for International Development and Microsoft ended.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Navigating Need and Want: 3 Ways to Create Demand Among Businesses to Safely Adopt Digital Tools</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“A good beginning is half of the success.”—ancient proverb&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As South and Southeast Asian digital economies rapidly expand, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the region face two dilemmas—both wrapped up in this one proverb. First, entrepreneurs can see the value of digital tools, practices, and infrastructure, but do they want to use them? Electronic payments, digital banking, and mobile applications clearly make business faster and more versatile, but not all business owners are ready to jump on the digital bandwagon. Second, businesses could adopt digital tools, practices, and infrastructure, but do they recognize the responsibilities that come with them? There are always benefits and risks of rushing to incorporate the latest online platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Localizing Digital Public Goods</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DAI is pleased to announce the release of its latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/digital-acceleration-solutions/cda-insights&quot;&gt;CDA Insights&lt;/a&gt; paper, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/Localizing%20Digital%20Public%20Goods.pdf&quot;&gt;Localizing Digital Public Goods&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global donors and development implementers are increasingly aligned around the theory that digital investments are most effective and equitable when owned by local stakeholders who can leverage the full potential of digital technologies and data. They are also embracing an agenda of “localization” to prioritize local digital ownership, expertise, and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Social Media for Civic Education: Challenges and Opportunities in Cambodia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abby Edwards, Aishwarya Jadav, Arin Kerstein, Alvin Siagian, and Shuyang Wang are second-year master’s students in the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies international development program. They worked with DAI from September 2022 to April 2023 on the Innovations for Social Accountability in Cambodia (ISAC) project, implemented by FHI 360 and funded by U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), to conduct an assessment of the Cambodian digital ecosystem and the digitalization of ISAC partner civil society organizations (CSOs). The team interviewed civic engagement experts, Cambodian CSOs working to implement the ISAC project, international organizations working in Cambodia, Cambodian content creators, and citizens in multiple ISAC target provinces. This post summarizes their key findings and recommendations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Some Spider-Sense to Kick Off 20 More Years of Cybersecurity Awareness</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the fifth in a series of blog posts about cybersecurity to mark Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October. This blog first appeared in the &lt;strong&gt;Tech Policy Press&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://techpolicy.press/some-spider-sense-to-kick-off-20-more-years-of-cybersecurity-awareness/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Spiderman,” as he was dubbed, worked for military intelligence as an undercover volunteer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As told by Nathan Thornburgh in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep590/05au/readings/titan.rain.htm&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Spiderman, later identified as Shawn Carpenter—a U.S. intel contractor by day—watched by night as hackers breached networks of the U.S. military and made off with uncommon stealth. Spiderman “clung unseen to the walls of their chat rooms and servers,” following the stolen files from site to site, landing him virtually in China’s Guangdong province. When his private-sector employers found out what he was doing, they fired Carpenter and stripped him of his top-secret clearance for “inappropriate” after-hours sleuthing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, in October 2004, a small nonprofit called the National Cyber Security Alliance, together with the new U.S. Department of Homeland Security, proclaimed the first National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. Their message: Update your antivirus software twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safe to say, cybersecurity awareness has come a long way since Spiderman got sacked.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>4 Key Takeaways from DAI’s Cybersecurity Programs in Southeast Asia and Mongolia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the fourth in a series of blog posts about cybersecurity to mark Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber threats in Southeast Asia are on the rise. Data from Singapore’s Ministry of Defense shows that cybercrime in the region &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/07/18/asia-pacific/asean-cyberattacks-operations-center/&quot;&gt;increased by 82 percent&lt;/a&gt; between 2021 and 2022. To help counter these growing threats, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Digital Asia Accelerator (DAA) initiative, implemented by DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df&quot;&gt;Digital Frontiers&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/digital-connectivity-and-cybersecurity-partnership/&quot;&gt;Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership (DCCP)&lt;/a&gt;, promotes cybersecurity awareness and capacity building in Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Mongolia, Myanmar, and Thailand. Since 2019, DAA has implemented several &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ictworks.org/effective-cybersecurity-awareness-programs/&quot;&gt;cybersecurity awareness initiatives&lt;/a&gt; in the region. Drawing on these experiences, here are four of our key takeaways on how to create an enabling environment for better cybersecurity awareness, defense, and opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Have We Learned in the Past Five Years about Cybersecurity?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the third in a series of blog posts about cybersecurity to mark Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For digital development practitioners, cybersecurity is now in the digital development zeitgeist. Over the past five years or so, it has become an important standalone technical area, as well as a critical building block of all our interventions. In honor of Cybersecurity Awareness Month, I wanted to revisit Digital@DAI’s earliest posts about cybersecurity from 2018 to see how our initial thinking holds up against a 2023 mindset. Our first-ever series on cybersecurity introduced the concept of cybersecurity to digital development practitioners by doing three things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/cybersecurity-series-part-1-trust-is-why-cyber-security-matters-to-digital-development.html?utm_source=related-box&quot;&gt;Providing a technical explanation&lt;/a&gt; of cybersecurity and linking it to the concept of trust;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/cyber-security-2.html&quot;&gt;Examining cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt; through the lens of regulations, skills, and institutions, aligned to the World Bank’s 2016 &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/896971468194972881/pdf/102725-PUB-Replacement-PUBLIC.pdf&quot;&gt;Digital Dividends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; report, and;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/cyber-security-series-part-3-pirated-software.html&quot;&gt;Examining the topic&lt;/a&gt; of pirated software at the micro level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>How Cybersecurity Literacy Can Help People Counter Disinformation and Exercise their Human Rights</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the second in a series of blog posts about cybersecurity to mark Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022&quot;&gt;2022 Threat Landscape Report&lt;/a&gt; published by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) highlights the spread of disinformation as one of the top eight cybersecurity &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20220120STO21428/cybersecurity-main-and-emerging-threats&quot;&gt;threats&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/Disinformation-Primer.pdf&quot;&gt;Disinformation Primer&lt;/a&gt; defines disinformation as information that is shared with the intent to mislead people. As the world becomes more digitally connected and as digital technologies become more integrated into different aspects of daily life, it is important to understand the impact of digital disinformation. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disinformation can cause people to stop trusting the institutions and systems that assist them in exercising their fundamental human rights.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Citizens who do not trust their electoral systems will be deterred from exercising their right to vote.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business owners who are hesitant to use digital technologies will find it harder to earn a good income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
