        <title>Designing a Wildlife Identification Tool in Philippines</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Human-centered design (HCD)—the design and management framework pioneered by greats like IDEO.org and taught in countless design and business schools—is taking the development world by storm. And rightly so, in our opinion. HCD’s focus on empathy and creativity helps us design better, more sustainable solutions to some of the most difficult development challenges. We won’t go into too much detail on the broader HCD process or its application in digital development; my colleagues have written extensively on the excellent design work they’ve facilitated in places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/5-tips-for-doing-international-design-research.html&quot;&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/hcd-in-the-field-trading-counterfeit-rupees-for-real-insights.html&quot;&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/governance-app-guatemala.html&quot;&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;. What we’d like to do today, rather, is tell you about the time we almost perished while shadowing rangers in the forests of the Philippines, and what we learned in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is possible there is a bit of hyperbole inserted here. Possibly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Apply Now to Redesign the USAID Center for Digital Development’s mAccess Online Platform</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A digital ecosystem is the how and why users interact with government services, digital financial tools, and each other using mobile devices. A single data point alone may not tell the whole story for digital inclusion and how to best reach those in low-connectivity settings globally. To help address this challenge, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Center for Digital Development (CDD) developed the mAccess diagnostic site, an online tool for global decision makers to analyze the availability, cost of connectivity, and number of users for more than 100 countries. The mAccess tool was launched in early 2016 and has been shared across USAID.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Identity Series Part 2: Digital Identity and Politics</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/uploads/Digital%20ID1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Digital ID1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt; Welcome back to the Digital Identity series. This week we continue the discussion of digital identity, with a focus on the politics of digital identification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the recognition that a formal identity is often a starting point for inclusion—without it, a person may not be able to access services such as health care, banking, or education. In humanitarian emergencies, a digital identity may be required to receive vital provisions such as food, water, and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Makes This Wireless Technology (5G) Different From All Other Wireless Technologies?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When thinking about the internet in an ideal world, I often think of an independent platform that provides a mechanism for free expression, commerce, and the exchange of ideas. Yet, as more and more of the global population comes online, the internet has become a reflection of global dynamics and geopolitical undercurrents. Today, this reality is manifesting itself around the impending roll out of 5G.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Tips for Doing International Design Research</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration (CDA) relies heavily on ethnographic design research in our work. By focusing our efforts on people &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the institutions around them, we:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Define the problem in their terms, not ours;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn of, and about, previous attempts to solve the problem;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop our understanding of local culture and history, as well as how people seek and share information and use mobile technology so we can meet them where they are;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mitigate the risks inherent to spending limited resources developing software or building digital tools, given the costs of doing so;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build ownership of the solution among the population; and…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enlist those who participate as promoters of the solution among their personal and professional networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>From One Qualie to Another: Insights from Qual360 2019</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a confession to make: I am a bonafide, card-carrying qualie. For those of you who aren’t familiar with this term, it’s a (nerdy) colloquialism to define people who are really into qualitative research. I swear, it’s a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, I am a qualie. I have been involved in conducting qualitative, ethnographic research in some way or another throughout the course of my sinuous career. I get jazzed by learning about people’s lived experiences—the barriers they encounter when attempting to improve their health and well being; the things that make changing behavior a snap; all of it. Throw some neuroscience in there to understand what’s happening in the brain and the ways in which emotional responses catalyze behavior change? Yes. Yes, please. I am in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Game Mechanics—Great Tool for Designing Digital Development Services</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;📱 Smartphone connections continue to rise and people, globally, love to game. The Global Systems for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) estimates that by 2025 78 percent of all developing market mobile connections &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsma.com/r/mobileeconomy/sub-saharan-africa/&quot;&gt;will be smart&lt;/a&gt;. By that time GSMA predicts that India will be the second-largest smartphone market by adoption globally (ahead of the United States), with 1 billion smartphone connections. Interestingly, India is already among the top five mobile gaming countries globally, expected to surge to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mmaglobal.com/files/casestudies/kantar_imrb_x_mma_x_pokkt_india_market_study.pdf&quot;&gt;368 million gamers in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. If this is a bellwether for developing markets, we can expect gaming to be a significant force across the global south.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Identity Series Part 1: Digital Identity and Informed Consent</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/uploads/Digital%20ID1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Digital ID1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt;This post marks the launch of a Digital Identity series here on Digital@DAI. It is a pivotal topic to many of our technical areas: from health service provision, to cash transfers, and voter registration. It is also a topic garnering increased attention with the debate over privacy and data security—and the global refugee crisis reinforcing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/213581486378184357/pdf/112614-REVISED-English-ID4D-IdentificationPrinciples-Folder-web-English-ID4D-IdentificationPrinciples.pdf&quot;&gt;opinion&lt;/a&gt; that there is “no single factor that affects a person’s ability to share in the gains of global development as much as having an official identity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few months, we will look at some of the issues and opportunities around Digital ID in the development space. Today, we look at informed consent: what it means to the development sector, the difficulty of getting it, and what we can do to make sure we aren’t leaving people behind, while respecting their privacy and the security of their data.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Nobody Cares What Tech You Use</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Technologists and developers love to talk about the best tools for building new technology. MERN or MEAN stack, functional vs. object-oriented programming, vanilla development or frameworks. The internet is ripe with these discussions and attend any tech meetup and you’ll easily find multiple discussions comparing one tool to another. The performance and usability of one over the other, as if that is the goal.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is Your Data in a Lake or Water Treatment Plant?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;They say to write about what you know. For the first part of my career and through my formal education, my work was all based in the world of water and sanitation. Glamorous stuff—pipes and pumps, fecal coli-forms and treatment options, toilets and activated sludge. It made for great dinner conversation (or so says my wife). At some point, I made the transition from a water guy who worked with a lot of data to a data scientist who knows about water. And as I dive deeper into the analogies and lingo of modern data systems and tools, I lean on my engineering training to make sense of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
