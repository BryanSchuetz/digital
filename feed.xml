        <title>Bridging the Gender Digital Divide: Four Approaches to Bringing Women Online From the USAID/Microsoft Airband Initiative</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Globally, women are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsma.com/r/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-Mobile-Gender-Gap-Report-2022.pdf&quot;&gt;18 percent&lt;/a&gt; less likely than men to own a smartphone. This statistic illustrates—particularly in low-income, rural households—the “gender digital divide,” where women are less likely to be connected to the internet and lack access to important tools that could improve their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gender digital divide limits women and girls’ opportunities on all fronts—from gaining an education to accessing their finances online to participating in politics and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing how digital inclusion empowers women and boosts the economies of rural communities, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/usaid-microsoft-airband-initiative&quot;&gt;USAID/Microsoft Airband Initiative&lt;/a&gt; has partnered with six private companies in five countries to provide women and girls with meaningful connectivity, internet access, and the skills necessary to navigate the digital world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/uploads/Photo%20Credit_%20New%20Sun%20Road.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photo Credit_ New Sun Road.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Photo: New Sun Road.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are four approaches that the USAID/Microsoft Airband Initiative is employing to bring women and girls in rural areas online:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Increasing Access: Connecting Women Through Digital Community Centers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital community centers are physical spaces that provide access to the internet, technology devices, and digital skills. Three of the initiative’s partners—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/anditel-factsheet&quot;&gt;Anditel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/new-sun-road-factsheet&quot;&gt;New Sun Road&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/bluetown-factsheet&quot;&gt;Bluetown&lt;/a&gt;—are operating community centers in remote areas that lack internet connectivity, involving women as both managers and customers. Altogether, these companies have established 26 digital community centers in the countries where they operate: Colombia, Guatemala, and Ghana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To encourage more women to visit, both Anditel and New Sun Road hired women from the communities to manage the centers and lead various activities and training. These leaders have brought positive change to their communities by promoting the adoption of digital technologies and helping visitors see how technology can bring value to their lives. They also provided digital literacy training and access to digital resources and created safe spaces for women to learn and use technology. To date, 26 community centers have trained more than 6,650 women on topics like email basics, safe internet browsing, digital content creation, how to use Microsoft Office applications and tips on becoming an entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“[The digital community center] inspired me to continue learning and acquiring technological skills. The digital literacy course and the leadership committee training have been a great personal contribution. Now, I am very happy working for the Community Center, and I am convinced that the teamwork that we achieve will contribute to its sustainability,” said Delﬁna Chó, a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Chajché, Guatemala. “We can be a good business model—an example and also an inspiration for other women and communities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure the centers’ sustainability, each partner has adopted different business models to generate revenue and continue operations. The New Sun Road centers are administered by women’s leadership committees and run as micro businesses. In addition to internet access, the centers offer services at a fee, including photocopying, printing, scanning, and phone and laptop charging, which fund the committees’ salaries and the centers’ operational costs. Similarly, Bluetown is considering turning the centers into internet cafés, where visitors pay a small fee to use its services. Anditel, on the other hand, is pursuing partnerships with local organizations so centers can continue their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Driving Meaningful Connectivity: Building Digital Literacy Skills Through Tailored Training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to the internet is just the first step in connecting remote areas to the rest of the world. The meaningful adoption of technology for personal and economic advancement is just as important. The USAID/Microsoft Airband Initiative partnered with AirJaldi, which provides broadband to India’s most remote areas, to increase women’s digital literacy skills through training and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a focus on accessibility and inclusivity, AirJaldi’s training is both virtual and face-to-face and tailored to meet the needs of all participants, regardless of their experience with technology. The modules provide women with the knowledge and skills to safely navigate the internet, access information and opportunities, and take advantage of the many benefits of technology. The modules are also regularly redesigned and updated based on participant feedback from surveys and focus groups.
Tashi, a salon owner, has used her new online skills to surf the web and grow her business. “The training has taught me the benefits of the internet,” she said, “I can visit YouTube to check out hairstyles and products.” Tashi is also using digital financial tools to offer a convenient payment option for her customers. “Nowadays many people don’t use cash so online payment has made transactions much easier,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other initiative partners have also tailored their training to help women effectively use the internet. Bluetown, for example, has established partnerships with different organizations to offer specific training at the center for its diverse visitors, with a focus on students, farmers, college graduates, and job seekers. In total, the initiative has taught digital literacy skills to more than 12,000 women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Empowering Women: Sales Strategies for Inclusive Connectivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritizing women’s needs can create more inclusive markets and help companies like M-KOPA to bridge the gender digital divide. M-KOPA provides underbanked customers in Africa with smartphones, internet plans, and other essential services. Over time, M-KOPA realized that it sold significantly more products to men than to women. By adopting innovative sales strategies to address this gap, M-KOPA increased its reach and brought the benefits of Internet access to more women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of M-KOPA’s key strategies was to increase the number of female sales agents in its workforce and incentivize sales to women. With more women in sales positions, M-KOPA created a more approachable environment for its female customers, who felt more trusting and at ease when speaking with other women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M-KOPA also provided its sales agents with access to M-KOPA Academy for training to better understand the specific needs, concerns, and preferences of female customers and how to effectively communicate with them. By training its sales agents, M-KOPA ensured they were well-equipped to engage with and provide more tailored service to female customers. Through the USAID/Microsoft Airband Initiative, M-KOPA reached more than 200,000 female customers and improved its overall sales outcomes—while ultimately helping bring more women online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Engaging Local Partners and Creating Community Networks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local partnerships and community engagement are instrumental in the USAID/Microsoft Airband Initiative. All six partners work with local organizations to respond to the needs and aspirations of women in rural areas, including inviting existing women’s associations and collectives to become involved in the centers and receive training on topics like digital agriculture for farmers, STEM for young girls, business management for entrepreneurs, and job-seeking skills for college graduates. Additionally, the partnerships have built networks where women find support, share knowledge, and connect with each other. This in turn promotes a sense of community and belonging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, Mawingu is another of the initiative’s partners, working in Kenya to expand the internet to rural and remote areas. In March 2022, Mawingu rolled out its Digital Biashara Networks, which are online-offline community forums for female entrepreneurs to connect and share experiences, challenges, and business advice, and provide mentorship to other women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rachel, a shop owner from Karagita, Kenya, was excited when she first heard about the program: “When Mawingu visited my shop and explained [the program], I immediately said ‘yes’ because I knew [what the] availability of internet means to me. When they introduced the training, I quickly jumped into it since I wanted to learn more tips on how I could grow my business. […] The network has also given me an opportunity to interact with other businesses so that we can learn from them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/uploads/Photo%20Credit_Mawingu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photo Credit_Mawingu.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Photo: Mawingu.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these four approaches, the USAID/Microsoft Airband Initiative has brought together diverse expertise and resources to improve the lives of women through meaningful internet connectivity. The initiative has reached more remote communities, bringing opportunities for women to invest in their personal and professional development and for its partners to test the feasibility of incorporating gender-specific approaches into their core business models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By developing interventions that respond to the specific needs of women and girls, the USAID/Microsoft Airband Initiative demonstrates the powerful potential of public-private partnerships in creating a more inclusive and equitable digital society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USAID/Microsoft Airband Initiative is implemented by DAI’s Digital Frontiers project, a buy-in mechanism that works closely with USAID Missions and Bureaus, the private sector, and international and local development organizations to identify successful and sustainable digital development approaches and scale their impact globally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Kids are Alright: Reframing “Digital Natives”  for International Development</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is adapted from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitaldevforum.com/agenda/the-kids-are-alright-reframing-digital-natives-for-international-development&quot;&gt;lightning talk&lt;/a&gt; presented at the 2023 Global Digital Development Forum (GDDF).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term digital native was coined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Prensky&quot;&gt;Mark Prensky&lt;/a&gt; in 2001. The writer and educator used it to broadly describe a generation that grew up in an era shaped by the internet and digital technology. Digital natives are believed to possess a mastery of technological skills that are inherently different from prior generations. Prensky referred to the arrival of the digital age as a “singularity” that caused students of the time to “think and process information fundamentally differently than their predecessors.” These skills were attributed to the early introduction of digital tools into the homes, schools, and social lives of young people and the perception that this technology is seamlessly integrated into their daily interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Toward More Transparent and Accountable AI Algorithms in Public Service Delivery: Insights from Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, and Rwanda</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;From our social media feeds to the societal benefits we receive, artificial intelligence (AI) is everywhere and affects everyone. AI may assist us in a variety of ways: it can execute difficult, risky, or tedious tasks on our behalf; assist us in saving lives and coping with natural disasters; entertain us; and make our daily lives more enjoyable. AI helps doctors make decisions about our health and helps judges and lawyers sift through cases, speeding up the judicial process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments worldwide are increasingly turning to AI algorithms to automate or support decision-making in public services. Algorithms assist in urban planning, prioritize social-care cases, make decisions about welfare entitlements, detect unemployment fraud, or monitor people in criminal justice and law enforcement settings. The use of these algorithms is often seen to improve efficiency and lower the costs of public services.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Frontier Insights Libya: Understanding Children’s Digital Access</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sesame Workshop and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) partnered to address the critical needs of children affected by the Syrian conflict and other crises in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ahlansimsim.org/&quot;&gt;Ahlan Simsim initiative&lt;/a&gt; addresses the urgent needs of children affected by crisis and conflict by creating educational resources that reach children through an award-winning and impactful TV series viewed by more than 23 million children and through early childhood services that integrate media reaching more than 1 million children and caregivers in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. Ahlan Simsim is exploring the possibility of expanding its work to other countries, specifically Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 18 months, DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration has been working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sesameworkshop.org/what-we-do/refugee-response&quot;&gt;Sesame Workshop&lt;/a&gt; to explore the possibilities for using digital tools to provide education services to young children living in crisis-affected communities. Using DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=digital-insights&quot;&gt;Frontier Insights™&lt;/a&gt; methodology, in 2021 DAI conducted research in &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/frontier-insights-yemen-understanding-childrens-digital-access.html&quot;&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/frontier-insights-colombia-understanding-childrens-digital-access.html&quot;&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/frontier-insights-south-sudan-understanding-childrens-digital-access.html&quot;&gt;South Sudan  &lt;/a&gt;to understand communities’ barriers to connectivity, technology usage habits, and ways to leverage those habits to improve access to educational content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October and November 2022, the team continued its research in Libya, focusing on three locations: Khoms (east of Tripoli), Brak al Shati (south), and Tripoli Center. The local research team conducted surveys with 64 households, focused on children ages 3–8 and their parents or caregivers. In this blog we share the findings from that research.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introducing Sesame Workshop’s Technology Decision Roadmap</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that Sesame Street has produced an immense amount of educational media content for children. The iconic video of the Count von Count muppet teaching children how to count to ten permeates through American society. This value has expanded beyond the United States, providing globally accessible videos to numerous countries. Most recently, in 2022, Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind Sesame Street, created a library of newly produced, modular, play-based, and globally relevant animation videos called Watch, Play, Learn (WPL) to be distributed in humanitarian contexts and beyond. The 140 segments are five minutes each and cover thematic early childhood development areas: science, math, social-emotional learning, and health, safety, and child protection.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lessons Learned in Bangladesh: Engaging Women in Digital Agriculture Tools</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The role of women in agriculture is crucial, especially in countries such as Bangladesh where they make up almost half of the sector’s labor force. However, women often have limited access to resources and assets that could improve their livelihoods, including information that can be accessed through technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital agriculture tools, such as mobile apps and texting services, can help overcome the information disparity between men and women. But first, it is essential to understand the unique challenges that women face in agriculture and how digital tools can address those challenges. Women often have limited access to land, capital, and information, which hinders their participation. Moreover, they have limited mobility, which makes it difficult for them to physically access markets and other agricultural services.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Digital Ecosystem Country Assessment (DECA) has Spurred Innovative Digital Development Around the World</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the Government of Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) brokered a peace accord that ended nearly five decades of internal armed conflict. After years of reconciliation and peacebuilding efforts, however, new emerging threats to civil society, while digital, have the potential to incite physical violence, according to findings in a 2020 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/digital-strategy/implementation-tracks/track1-adopt-ecosystem/digital-ecosystem-country-assessments&quot;&gt;Digital Ecosystem Country Assessment&lt;/a&gt; (DECA) report published by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalfrontiersdai.com/&quot;&gt;Digital Frontiers&lt;/a&gt; project. The report recommended that USAID invest in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/cybersecurity&quot;&gt;cyber hygiene programming&lt;/a&gt; in Colombia to assess and improve online and offline safety. Today, USAID Colombia has partnered with USAID’s Digital APEX project to build just this type of capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As more USAID Missions like Colombia’s grapple with the emerging opportunities and challenges of our digital world, the Digital Strategy is shaping the Agency’s response. To design policies and programs that take advantage of technology, stakeholders need to first understand the building blocks of a country’s digital landscape. The DECA, a cornerstone of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/digital-strategy&quot;&gt;Digital Strategy&lt;/a&gt;, is helping development practitioners to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preparing International Development Professionals for the Digital Age</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/preparing-international-development-professionals-digital-age&quot;&gt;originally appeared&lt;/a&gt; on the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapid advances in technology are transforming every industry in the global economy. In particular, the disruption created by the COVID-19 pandemic pushed governments, companies, and citizens to adopt a wide range of digital solutions. Many activities—including government services, work, schooling, and retail—shifted online. The pandemic also revealed that workers and regular citizens were not equipped with the right skills to operate in the digital age. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-eurostat-news/-/ddn-20220330-1&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by the European Commission in 2021 revealed that only 54 percent of Europeans possess basic digital skills. In 2022, Salesforce’s new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2022/01/27/digital-skills-index-update/&quot;&gt;Digital Skills Index&lt;/a&gt; found that three out of four workers globally did not feel ready to operate in a digital-first world. Most worrisome is the fact that the same study revealed only 28 percent of respondents were actively engaged in training programs or pursuing learning opportunities to acquire digital skills.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Realizing Inclusive Connectivity in Liberia Through a Trusted Technical Engagement</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Transmitting data through transparent fibers barely thicker than a human hair, the Africa Coast to Europe (ACE) optical-fiber submarine cable system revolutionized Liberia’s information and communications technology (ICT) sector. Landing off the shore of Liberia’s capital, Monrovia, in 2011, this 17,000-kilometer cable that stretches from France to South Africa marked the country’s introduction to high-speed internet. Providing connectivity to 24 countries, the cable also demonstrated a commitment to reduce the digital divide and democratize internet access in Africa through secure, diverse, and resilient ICT infrastructure investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ACE, made possible through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ace-submarinecable.com/en/members/&quot;&gt;landmark agreement&lt;/a&gt; between a consortium of telecommunications companies and member countries, significantly increased connectivity in Monrovia, the lack of optical fiber cables beyond the capital resulted in low connectivity in Liberia’s rural areas. Moreover, Liberia lacks a much-needed system of high-speed networks linked together with fiber-optic connections to establish what is formally known as a fiber backbone—a critical prerequisite to fully maximize the ACE cable’s potential.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Downsides: The Economic Impact of Misinformation and Other Digital Harms on MSMEs in Kenya, India, and Cambodia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE: The full report is now available for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/uploads/digital-downsides.pdf&quot;&gt;download here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digitalization presents both opportunities and challenges for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in emerging markets. Digital tools can increase business efficiency and reach, but also increase exposure to misinformation, fraud, and cyber attacks. Such “digital downsides” can lead to financial losses, reputational damage, loss of customer trust, and other challenges that hinder MSMEs’ ability—and desire—to participate in the digital economy. In this post, we’re previewing a soon-to-be-released report that DAI authored about the economic impact of misinformation and other digital harms on MSMEs in Kenya, India, and Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of our research, and with the help of our in-country local partners, we asked 85 business owners about their understanding and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/building-resilience-against-disinformation.html&quot;&gt;awareness of misinformation&lt;/a&gt; and other digital downsides and the impact of these experiences on their businesses. We further wanted to understand the types of digital tools (social media platforms, messaging services, digital payment devices, etc.) that business owners in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs) use and what gaps exist that could be filled through training or by government, private sector, nonprofit and other actors. Lastly, we uncovered how misinformation factors into a business context, rather than an electoral or public health context (which is how misinformation has typically been studied).&lt;/p&gt;
