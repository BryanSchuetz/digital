        <title>How to Engage and Support Local Innovators: 3 Takeaways from the Digital Development Forum</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On March 9, I moderated a workshop called “How to Engage and Support Local Innovators” at the USAID &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitaldevelopment.org/digital-development-forum-2018&quot;&gt;Digital Development Forum&lt;/a&gt;. I was joined by three expert panelists: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielle-dhillon-a82a9859/&quot;&gt;Danielle Dhillon&lt;/a&gt; from the Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) at the UN Foundation; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonieliasz/&quot;&gt;Toni Eliasz&lt;/a&gt; from the World Bank’s Digital Entrepreneurship Program; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tylerradford/&quot;&gt;Tyler Radford&lt;/a&gt; from the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT). All three are focused on nurturing local technologists and innovators. Toni and Danielle support local startup ecosystems and Tyler builds communities of volunteer mappers. What have they learned through these efforts?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Playing The Right Role In Haiti’s Growing Mobile Sector: 4 Key Principles</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital financial services have been a robust part of the development sector for over a decade and their impact continues to grow. This blog post is part of a series produced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://mstarproject.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;mStar&lt;/a&gt; that focuses on successful projects that achieve results-driven impact in people’s lives. This post was originally published on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mstarproject.wordpress.com/2018/03/12/haitis-growing-mobile-sector/&quot;&gt;mStar digital development blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/rsz_haiti_dfs_photo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rsz_haiti_dfs_photo.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an exciting time for mobile money expansion in Haiti. Digicel’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQQFqoHzdo&quot;&gt;MonCash&lt;/a&gt;—Haiti’s largest mobile money deployment—has reached nearly 1 million customers and $400 million in yearly transacted value in 2017. This customer base represents a +1500 percent increase from 2015, the same year Digicel rebooted its strategy, marketing approach, product offering, and sales and training force.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ICT for Citizen Engagement and Advocacy: Lessons Learned from Mozambique DIÁLOGO</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/mozambique-democratic-governance-support-programme-dgsp&quot;&gt;Mozambique Democratic Governance Programme&lt;/a&gt;, DIÁLOGO, funded by the U.K. Department for International Development, worked with citizens, civil society, local media, and municipal government to engage more effectively on local issues. DIÁLOGO supported innovative solutions, including mobile- and web-based technologies, to amplify the voices of citizens and help governments respond to their demands. The programme ran from 2012 in the five urban municipalities of Beira, Maputo, Nampula, Quelimane, and Tete, and ended last December.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DFID’s Digital Strategy: What Does it Mean for DAI?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month, the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) launched its much-anticipated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfid-digital-strategy-2018-to-2020-doing-development-in-a-digital-world&quot;&gt;Digital Strategy 2018-2020: Doing Development in a Digital World&lt;/a&gt;, outlining its vision and approach towards using technology to have a bigger, faster, and more cost-effective impact on the lives of poor people—particularly those who are marginalised.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Getting Past the Blockchain Hype Cycle</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), commonly referred to as blockchain applications, are possibly the most talked about innovation of the day. And the most commonly discussed DLT applications are those that involve financial transactions with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency&quot;&gt;cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Fortune Magazine&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2017/12/26/4-technology-trends-2018/&quot;&gt;recently listed&lt;/a&gt; “The Fintech Renaissance” as the second-most important technology trend of 2018, and with good reason. Last month Bitcoin saw more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?timespan=all&quot;&gt;400,000 transactions&lt;/a&gt; per day. Despite warnings of Bitcoin’s volatility, the increased investment in cryptocurrencies is hard to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about all of the other promises of DLTs? There are no shortage of articles written about their impact on data security, the value of smart contracts to create efficient online transactions, and the value of data democratization and transparency through shared ledgers. While there are case studies for each of these promising areas, distributed application developers are in short supply, and active implementations for global development projects are rare. As a result, I get the sense that blockchain may be entering the peak if its hype cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>“S3” Site Selection System: A Data-Driven Decision-Making Tool for Effective Engagement</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently while on assignment in Haiti, a project manager for a local agricultural development project asked my team why we weren’t targeting certain rural communities. According to him, those communities are the ones that could really benefit from the type of work we were doing. While we had good reason to work where we were working, the question stuck: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can we be certain that we are targeting the right communities?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>We Don’t Need to Reinvent the Wheel, But it’s Time to Invest in Roads and Highways</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s the good news: Over the past 10 years the digital health community has begun to heal from a severe case of pilotitis. As a community of innovators and health systems researchers, we increasingly recognize that creating and testing new digital health tools in the absence of investments in the enabling ecosystem is likely to produce limited, short-term, and small-scale impact. Without concerted efforts to fertilize the soil in which the seeds of innovation are planted, those seeds will never mature beyond a sapling. That is, unless we pay attention to the policy and regulatory environment, the telecommunications and electrical infrastructure, and most importantly, the availability of trained and appropriate human resources to facilitate scale-up and sustainability, we cannot expect national-scale digital health projects to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
