        <title>What We Learned From a Deep Dive into the World of Prizes and Challenges</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, our colleagues at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USAID_Digital_Asia_Accelerator_Fact_Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;Digital Asia Accelerator&lt;/a&gt; buy-in under the Digital Frontiers project asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/authors/alexander-sekhniashvili/&quot;&gt;Alex Sekhniashvili&lt;/a&gt; and I to identify and synthesize lessons learned administering prizes and challenges across the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) portfolio. Given DAI’s long history implementing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-grand-challenges-development-implementation-services&quot;&gt;Grand Challenges for Development Implementation Services&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-center-development-innovation-professional-management-services&quot;&gt;Center for Development Innovation (CDI) Professional Management Services,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df&quot;&gt;Digital Frontiers&lt;/a&gt; projects on behalf of USAID—there are quite a lot of lessons! So Alex and I dove deep into the world of prizes and challenges, reading project documents and interviewing a number of DAI staff. Read below some of our findings.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Platform Unites Afghan Activists</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since 2015, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/afghanistan-musharikat&quot;&gt;Promote: Musharikat&lt;/a&gt; program has been promoting the meaningful civic participation of Afghan women. To date, more than 7,000 activists and 370 civil society organizations (CSO), across all 34 of Afghanistan’s provinces, have chosen to join DAI-led Musharikat to advance women’s equality and empowerment. By working through coalitions, Musharikat brings together citizen activists, government officials, religious scholars, and a diverse assemblage of CSOs to bolster both the supply and demand for women’s rights in Afghanistan. Though each coalition has a specific mandate, their shared vision of a peaceful, inclusive, and equitable country provides a common cause for action. This mission includes public awareness campaigns, building the capacity of those championing change, and working with government institutions to vigorously enforce and reform laws to fulfill their duty to the nation’s largest underserved constituency—women.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Apply Now to Implement the Next ICTforAg Conference</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ictforag.com/&quot;&gt;ICTforAg 2020&lt;/a&gt; engaged a global audience of 1,502 participants across 26 sessions over the course of one day. The conference examined digital solutions in agriculture as a means of fostering resilience in the wake of disruptions, from climate-related disasters to COVID-19, and the intersections between them. Building on the momentum of this global event, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df&quot;&gt;Digital Frontiers&lt;/a&gt; team is supporting the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/organization/bureaus/bureau-resilience-and-food-security&quot;&gt;Bureau for Resilience and Food Security&lt;/a&gt; in the next ICTforAg conference.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Job Postings from Mexico's Energy Sector Reveal About the State of Clean Energy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A significant challenge to achieving the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals&quot;&gt;Sustainable Development Goals&lt;/a&gt; has been measuring country progress in the transition to renewable and clean energy sources. While expert surveys or legislation enacted may provide some insight into how countries are progressing on the whole, they lack the granularity to inform us about subnational trends, skills in-demand, and the presence of firms and subsectors within each country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One useful way to explore these factors is by analyzing data available from job search engines and using keywords related to the energy sector. These can provide insights on how jobs in key sectors and subsectors evolve over time, what the demand for labor among firms in the energy sector is, where these openings and firms are located, and how they differ in terms of skills sought in the labor market.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Advances in ICT Connectivity Highlight Need for Digital Safety Preparedness in Pacific Communities</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pacific Islands have the lowest rate of mobile &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pacificislandtimes.com/post/2020/01/04/the-connectivity-gap-in-the-pacific&quot;&gt;internet penetration&lt;/a&gt; in the world and fixed broadband connection levels far below that of their neighbors. Recent and planned investments in building out undersea fiber optic cable and satellite services—including those financed by the United Nations, World Bank, and Asian Development Bank—are striving to change this, boosting internet speeds and expanding access to citizens, governments, and businesses across the region. In recent weeks I’ve spoken with a number of experts in the Pacific Islands about their concerns and priorities around this topic. Below are a few common themes that resonated throughout my conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Are We Reading about Technology and Ethics?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Tech ethics have continued to claim the public spotlight as more accounts of bias and harm due to technology and artificial intelligence (AI) have appeared in the media. Stories from racial bias in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03228-6&quot;&gt;health care algorithms&lt;/a&gt; to gender bias in &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/article/amazon-sexist-recruiting-algorithm-gender-bias-ai/&quot;&gt;hiring algorithms&lt;/a&gt; have uncovered the lack of neutrality in technology that has previously been assumed to be completely objective and neutral.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Satellite Imagery and ‘Light at Night’ Helps Development Practitioners Estimate GDP</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am sure many of you have come across a map like the one below. I find that images of our planet are always awe-inspiring and this image is certainly not an exception. I can easily get lost in satellite imagery for hours if I am not careful. Most of those images are based on visual spectrum optical technology (LandSAT, Sentinel, etc.), thus requiring daylight for the powerful digital cameras to “see.” Remote sensing satellites such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncc.nesdis.noaa.gov/VIIRS/&quot;&gt;VIIRS&lt;/a&gt;—which DAI uses for its analysis—are equipped with special infrared equipment and able to capture beautiful images of the earth at night!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Innovator Series: Talking Girls in Tech with Voneat Pen</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kate Heuisler recently spoke with Voneat Pen, the Chapter Ambassador for &lt;a href=&quot;https://technovationcambodia.com/&quot;&gt;Technovation&lt;/a&gt; in Cambodia, about her work growing the successful all-girl tech entrepreneurship education program for the seventh year in a row. While juggling her roles as the co-founder of the tech startup &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/606Digital/&quot;&gt;606&lt;/a&gt;, a programmer, and STEM advocate, Voneat has been instrumental to Technovation’s success during its most challenging years. When COVID-19 pushed the program online overnight, the Technovation community (and its partners) were still able to successfully engage new all-girl teams, mentors, schools, and provinces across the country. To date, Technovation has helped connect more than 2,000 Cambodian girls to essential 21st-century tech creator skills.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an excerpt from that interview.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fast Company's World Changing Ideas Awards Highlight Opportunities for Digital Development</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Fast Company magazine has been around for decades…but is it relevant for digital development work? The publication was founded in 1995 at a time when business was changing the world in new ways. Today, 26 years later, we are still coming to terms with the ways that technologies are transforming the ways we work and live—especially during the COVID-19 global pandemic. As I work with clients and projects focused on digital development, the businesses and organizations featured in Fast Company offer new ideas, inspiration, and out-of-the-box thinking to those of us heads down in global development projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I wanted to share some of the winners of Fast Company’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90623897&quot;&gt;2021 World-Changing Ideas Awards&lt;/a&gt;—and how these innovations could apply to our work. World Changing Ideas is one of Fast Company’s major annual awards programs and is focused on social good, seeking to elevate finished products and brave concepts that make the world better.&lt;/p&gt;
