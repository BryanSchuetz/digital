        <title>Digital Development for Newbies, Part 1: The Basics</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I joined DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration (CDA) several months ago as an international development professional: familiar with ADS 302, Geo Code 937, Form AID 1420-17, among other industry acronyms, but a newcomer to the language of tech trends, digital buzzwords, and product design. I found the CDA team to be both inspiring and daunting, boasting individuals with unique expertise and passions—whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=cyber-security-series&quot;&gt;cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=human-centered-design&quot;&gt;human-centered design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=remote-sensing-series&quot;&gt;remote sensing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=blockchain-serieshttps://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=blockchain-series&quot;&gt;blockchain&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/what-good-is-the-internet-of-things-to-people-who-dont-have-internet.html&quot;&gt;Internet of Things&lt;/a&gt;. As a neophyte, it’s easy to be overwhelmed by what you don’t know in the seemingly limitless world of digital technology but I’m here to help! If you, too, are new to this sphere, what do you need to know to integrate digital tools into your development programs or proposals? Below are some key points to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Applying the Principles for Digital Development in a Flourishing Digital Ecosystem</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a co-facilitator at a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/agriculture-and-food-security/increasing-food-security-through-feed-future&quot;&gt;Feed the Future&lt;/a&gt; training on digital development for resilience and food security in Nairobi, I was struck by the stark contrast between the short amount of time (a scant four years) I’ve been settling debts with friends on Venmo and the participants’ resounding “we’ve been using it forever” response when I asked how long they had been using Kenya’s mobile payment system, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-rctom/submission/m-pesa-transforming-kenya-with-mobile-money/&quot;&gt;M-Pesa&lt;/a&gt;. While I can imagine a world without Venmo, it is clear that, for many Kenyans, life without M-Pesa is inconceivable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Confidence Not Competence: What Holds Women Back from Embracing Tech in Development</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout my life, I’ve heard women grumble about using technology—from my mom, from friends in school, and from work colleagues—yet these are highly educated, often extremely logical thinkers that excel at, well, Excel!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irony of the situation has been troubling me in the past few months. Why? Because there is a clear contrast in attention paid to the benefits of empowering women and girls through technology in low-and middle-income countries, with the attention paid to empowering women and girls through technology in high-income environments.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lessons from Cambodia: How to Grow a Girls’ Tech Entrepreneurship Challenge in Six Years</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you get Cambodian girls &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.development-innovations.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Factors-Affecting-Women-Engaging-in-Tech-Careers-in-Cambodia-Report.pdf&quot;&gt;engaged&lt;/a&gt; in addressing the digital gender divide? This is a question that the six-year &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.development-innovations.org/&quot;&gt;Development Innovations (DI) project&lt;/a&gt; has been wrestling with since it was launched by the U.S. Agency for International Development—and that DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/digital-acceleration&quot;&gt;Center for Digital Acceleration (CDA)&lt;/a&gt; and DI have &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/defeated-by-the-digital-divide-invest-in-inclusion.html&quot;&gt;regularly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/powering-women-entrepreneurs-in-cambodia.html&quot;&gt;chronicled&lt;/a&gt; on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.development-innovations.org/?s=technovation&quot;&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lessons from the Makerspace Community in High-Income Countries</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Makerspaces—akin to coworking spaces with tools such as 3D printers and computer numerical control (CNC) mills as well as more traditional woodworking and metalworking items—offer participants access to equipment traditionally the domain of specialists or well-funded firms. Along with the proliferation of independent makerspaces starting in the mid-2000s, national organizations emerged to promote the model and connect regional maker communities, as well as offer a commercial platform for vendors making innovative tools for that market.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Visualizing Remotely Sensed Data: True Color and False Color</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What kind of images do you think of when you imagine Google Maps of our planet? Landmarks? Roads? Roads on top of satellite imagery? When we see that satellite imagery base map, we generally expect to see a representation of the earth that matches our reality. This is what we call in the world of remote sensing, “natural color.” For the average person, this use of earth-sensing satellites is the most useful, but in reality it represents only a fraction of the information gathered.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Center for Digital Acceleration Partners with Award-Winning Tech Startup Skilllab</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the ways DAI tackles global challenges is by partnering with other innovators to invest in promising solutions. In joining forces with tech startups that align with our mission, we bring the power of technology and entrepreneurship to bear on global development challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, for example, we supported four startups through our ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/news/dai-and-partners-launch-innovation-action-challenge&quot;&gt;Innovation into Action Challenge&lt;/a&gt;’, including education tech firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.laboratoria.la/en&quot;&gt;Laboratoria&lt;/a&gt;, renewable energy enterprise &lt;a href=&quot;https://solarsister.org/&quot;&gt;Solar Sister&lt;/a&gt;, and m-health platforms &lt;a href=&quot;https://clickmedix.com/&quot;&gt;ClickMedix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinkmd.org/&quot;&gt;ThinkMD&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier this year, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/news/dai-global-health-invests-in-mhealth-leader-clickmedix&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;  our investment in ClickMedix. We’ve also invested in Ghanaian startups that emerged from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/new-cda-insights-publication-building-the-future-of-tech-enabled-agriculture.html&quot;&gt;Kosmos Innovation Center&lt;/a&gt;. Keeping with this tradition, DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration is pleased to announce a new strategic partnership with our friends and colleagues at &lt;a href=&quot;https://skilllab.io/&quot;&gt;Skilllab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Navigating Barriers to Digital Inclusion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first began learning about digital development, I thought of it as a new frontier that could push international development out of its modus operandi. New digital tools could provide individuals, communities, governments, and organizations with new sources of information at rapid speeds—enabling new means of collaboration to propel development objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital technology is unique for two reasons. First, digital is &lt;em&gt;informative&lt;/em&gt;—providing users with increased access to new information and opportunities at their fingertips. Second, digital is &lt;em&gt;informed&lt;/em&gt;—enabling users to input information that will conceivably be used by industries and governments to tailor and update their products and benefit their business and economies to improve customer experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Understanding Cybersecurity for Healthcare Professionals</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We live in exciting times. The ways in which we store and engage with health data have been transformed with the creation and adoption of digital health technology. Whether it’s using a Fitbit, accessing your vaccine records online, or virtually connecting with your doctor, understanding your health status in real time has never been easier… for some of us. We at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/global-health&quot;&gt;DAI Global Health&lt;/a&gt; are working tirelessly to increase access to healthcare in low- and middle-income countries by leveraging digital health technologies. The goal is to empower patients and professionals providing care to them to use data to make smart decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New USAID Guide: How to Create Digital ID for Inclusive Development</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Access the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s new &lt;a href=&quot;https://nam03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usaid.gov%2Fdigital-development%2Fdigital-id%2Fhow-to-guide&amp;amp;data=01%7C01%7CStephanie_Creed%40dai.com%7C1f9cda42f7114bd429d508d71147871e%7C7107113de20b4c20a4ce553cabbf686d%7C0&amp;amp;sdata=hn%2F6OZETU58OZUX59RCvfLdR8UywARdX66Or14vgUok%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;&gt;Guide to Creating Digital ID for Inclusive Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identity is deeply personal. Issues of identity are complex and tied up with power, privacy, and protection. Yet identifying constituents is often critical to organizing and managing global development projects. Decades of development work have relied on ad hoc identity systems to administer programs, yet today we find that nearly 1 billion people still lack representative identification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USAID’s 2017 report &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/15396/IDENTITY_IN_A_DIGITAL_AGE.pdf&quot;&gt;Identity in a Digital Age: Infrastructure for Inclusive Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; documented some of the complexities that arise when we create or use digital ID in development programming. Done well, these systems can provide a unique, trusted, multipurpose ID to everyone, which is key to economic and social development.&lt;/p&gt;
