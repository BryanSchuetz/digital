        <title>Apply Now: RFP for an Innovative Partner to Fight Fall Armyworm</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, DAI releases an RFP looking for a prize implementation partner to confront fall armyworm head on. This partner will join DAI and USAID in designing a results-driven prize to find digital tools and services that help smallholder farmers across sub-Saharan Africa.
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/34880771941_a99698095a_z-089e50.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;34880771941_a99698095a_z-089e50.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A farmer in Ethiopia inspects his fall armyworm-infested maize. (Photo Credit: FAO/Tamiru Legesse)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backstory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, the fall armyworm is marching across the African continent, causing more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cabi.org/Uploads/isc/Dfid%20Faw%20Inception%20Report04may2017final.pdf&quot;&gt;$13 billion in crop losses&lt;/a&gt;. If left unchecked, this insect could continue to cost &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/25/invasion-of-maize-eating-caterpillars-worsens-hunger-crisis-in-africa-fall-armyworm&quot;&gt;$6 billion a year&lt;/a&gt;. What makes this pest so devastating to farmers across the region? First of all, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2017/06/07/fall-armyworm-outbreaks-in-the-sadc-region-how-to-respond/&quot;&gt;not only eats the vegetative parts of the plants, but also consumes the reproductive portions&lt;/a&gt;, completely destroying crops. Secondly, it can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2017/06/07/fall-armyworm-outbreaks-in-the-sadc-region-how-to-respond/&quot;&gt;fly up to 1,600 kilometers (nearly 1,000 miles)&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it can easily migrate to surrounding farms and countries. Finally, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cimmyt.org/press_release/multi-pronged-approach-key-for-effectively-defeating-fall-armyworm-in-africa/&quot;&gt;insect attacks more than 80 plant species&lt;/a&gt;, including maize, which more than 200 million people across sub-Saharan Africa depend upon. Basically, this insect eats fast, travels far, and poses a critical threat to Africa’s food security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, USAID is launching a call for innovative, digital solutions to help smallholder farmers confront fall armyworm and protect their crops. To support this call, DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df&quot;&gt;USAID-funded Digital Frontiers project&lt;/a&gt; is looking for a prize implementation firm to design, launch, implement and evaluate a results-driven prize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to Know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prize launch:&lt;/strong&gt; Early 2018
&lt;strong&gt;Deadline for proposals:&lt;/strong&gt; January 5, 2018 at 5 PM EST
&lt;strong&gt;Contact:&lt;/strong&gt; DigitalFrontiers@dai.com
&lt;strong&gt;Estimated award:&lt;/strong&gt; $645,000 - $745,000
&lt;strong&gt;Scope:&lt;/strong&gt; See the full RFP[LINK].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Should Apply?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for an experienced open innovation competition firm to run this prize from start to finish. The ideal partner has wide range of experience, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designing open innovation competitions with USAID&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designing and running a communications and outreach campaign&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Managing events&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the full RFP[LINK]. Have the expertise we’re looking for? Apply now[LINK]! All applications are due January 5 at 5 PM EST.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tailored Technology Enhances Resilience Programming</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;FHI360 recently hosted its annual Technology for Resilience workshop in Bangkok. In doing so, conference organizers created an opportunity for technologists and development practitioners to learn from active technology projects that promote community resilience, and work together on innovative solutions to what are often seen as intractable problems. In this post, I’ll look at some of the technologies showcased during the conference. But before doing so, let’s define resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cyber Violence Against Women and Girls Exacerbates Digital Exclusion</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Raise your hand if you have experienced online harassment. I am sure the response is a virtual flurry. Although digital technologies have the ability to empower, connect, and liberalise, they can also serve as platforms for marginalisation and abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent news stories such as those from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/05/diane-abbott-more-abused-than-any-other-mps-during-election&quot;&gt;UK General Election&lt;/a&gt; have shone a light on the targeting of female politicians and journalists and high-profile cases of cyber bullying of young girls have shocked people world over. Whilst we know well the veracity of online violence, a less prominent issue is how it can exacerbate levels of digital exclusion for already marginalised populations. Let’s take a look at how online violence against women and girls—or “cyber VAWG”—further impedes digital inclusion and prevents women and girls from enjoying digital dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Podcasts for Human-Centered Designers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In international development, human-centered designer (HCD) is charged with rapidly developing empathy with a specific, targeted marginalized population, a social challenge that group faces, and parlaying that understanding into a local solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/headphones.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;headphones.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing so successfully requires one primary skill: &lt;strong&gt;listening.&lt;/strong&gt; That means listening in the traditional sense: to an individual, as DAI does in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/rwanda-digital-insights.html&quot;&gt;Digital Insights&lt;/a&gt; work. But, more broadly, listening for design in the international development space means listening to an entire population to identify social challenges as well as the cultural, political, and economic dynamics that affect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The podcasts below are all about people who know how to listen. They’ve expanded my understanding of design and sharpened my ability to listen closely when I’m designing a solution. I hope they’ll do the same for you, should you take the time to &lt;em&gt;listen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Insights: Would Haitians use Mobile Money for Banking?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In late September, I traveled to Haiti to conduct research on how Haitians engage with financial institutions and mobile technology to explore the feasibility of introducing mobile money as an avenue for the provision of financial services. Together with the team from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/haiti-finance-inclusive-fininc&quot;&gt;USAID/Haiti Finance Inclusive project&lt;/a&gt;, implemented by DAI, and with support from our sister USAID/Haiti project Finance Pour Tous and two key credit unions—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/CPFRATERNITE/&quot;&gt;Caisse Populaire Fraternite (CPF)&lt;/a&gt; and Socolavim—I visited nine locations through the northern and central provinces of the country to interview 181 credit union customers as they went about their business.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why a Dashboard Isn’t Just a Dashboard</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I distinctly remember an early conversation with colleagues when I began working in digital development in which a peer dismissively waved his hand at the idea of implementing a live data dashboard, saying “A dashboard is a dashboard is a dashboard!” The finality of that line stuck with me. I assumed that the dismissal came from a person who was bored with dashboards, like a kid who opens a birthday present to find he has received yet ANOTHER dashboard. Well, interactive data dashboards—just like automobile dashboards—may not be the newest, hottest, shiniest thing in the ICT4D toolbox, but they’re still important and their often hidden values go unappreciated by many.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>8 Do’s and Don’ts in Adaptive Management and Learning in ICT4D</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a guest post by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/kate-heuisler&quot;&gt;Kate Heuisler&lt;/a&gt;, Chief of Party of DAI’s USAID-funded Cambodia Development Innovations project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.development-innovations.org/&quot;&gt;Development Innovations&lt;/a&gt; supports innovators and boosts the use of information and communication technologies for the overall development of Cambodia. The project is structured to be flexible and adaptive—because we need to. Really, most creative development programs &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; build themselves to be learning organizations, to be ready for big pivots, regardless if you and your partners use digital innovations. The development world is regularly disrupted—by political changes, natural disasters, new technologies such as social media—and is no longer built for static, five-year plans. Donors and funders need partners that can learn by doing, and are not afraid to adapt strategies and implementation plans to continually improve.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>GeekFest 2017: Delving into Public Access with Duduzile Mkhwanazi of Project Isizwe</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/geek%20fest%20smallest.jpg?download&quot; alt=&quot;geek fest logo&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt;
Welcome to GeekFest 2017, a series of interviews featuring ICT4D thought leaders. Our goals for #geekfest2017 are: to highlight the people and organizations who are pushing the field in new directions, to feature their work and show how it’s different or new, and to support the overall growth of the ICT4D community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we are focusing on public access as a solution to closing the Digital Divide. Being able to access free public wifi can be crucial for those who cannot afford internet subscriptions: It can be the difference between finally finding that job, getting the training you need or linking up with a valuable investor for your new venture. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://a4ai.org/affordability-report/report/2017/&quot;&gt;2017 A4AI  Affordability Report&lt;/a&gt; noted the importance of public wifi for engendering use of the internet: Research shows public wifi as one of the most popular options for online access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat down with Duduzile Mkhwanazi, CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.projectisizwe.org/&quot;&gt;Project Isizwe&lt;/a&gt;-an organization making great strides in providing free public wifi in South Africa, a country where inequality is rife and the affordability of mobile data is just out of reach for many, despite &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mobileconnectivityindex.com/#year=2016&amp;amp;zoneIsocode=ZAF&quot;&gt;99 percent 3G coverage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
