        <title>Going Virtual with Learning</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For some professions, the past year has normalized virtual interactions and digital collaboration. While many jobs and activities still require in-person interaction, others have moved online as much as possible. Conferences are virtual. Weekly meetings take place through a screen. And classrooms have gone online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people who have engaged with learning this past year have had some kind of digital experience. This is true across all ages—and, we have seen, often with mixed success. Nevertheless, at our Center for Digital Acceleration, we know that, as the saying goes—“the show must go on”—and we have done our best to help DAI’s projects around the globe make their in-person courses and activities come alive in our virtual world. In this post, we offer some brief reflections on the different types of online training our projects are developing, and then ask the question: is this the new normal?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>In Honor of Women’s History Month: Exploring the Gender Digital Divide</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With March being Women’s History Month, it feels appropriate to reflect on progress made towards the United Nations’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/&quot;&gt;Sustainable Development Goal No. 5&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls&lt;/em&gt;. Over the years, development programs have made significant strides in recognizing and alleviating the inequality that exists between men and women worldwide, though there is still much to be done. From DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration’s perspective, it is particularly important to highlight the disparities that exist in the realm of digital tools and opportunities. In today’s world, where access to the internet and digital applications is increasingly valuable for both personal and professional purposes, female empowerment efforts must include the prioritization of women’s digital access, literacy, and inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Are We Reading about Digital Transformation and COVID-19?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I find it difficult to use the word in this context, but there may be one &lt;strong&gt;positive&lt;/strong&gt;—if not collateral—effect of COVID-19: after the decades of support the digital development community has provided to businesses and consumers around the world to help, the adoption of digital technologies has accelerated in mere months. There’s a new willingness to embrace the digital economy, as restrictions against in-person interactions move people online and require the use of digital tools out of necessity. This process, often called digital transformation, has been discussed by a variety of sources, outlining both its benefits and risks. We thought it might be helpful to provide an overview of some of the articles, blogs, and resources we are reading to leverage this momentum. This list is by no means exhaustive, but rather provides a few highlights to get you started. I’ve broken down the readings into three, highly academic categories: 1. This is really happening, 2. and the benefits could be huge, 3. but please do not forget the risks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Electronic Waste is Relevant for the Digital Development Community</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently cleaning my house when I came across three old mobile phones: a feature phone, a BlackBerry, and an iPhone. I found myself wondering, “&lt;em&gt;Why did I keep these?&lt;/em&gt;” Immediately, I thought, “&lt;em&gt;the pictures&lt;/em&gt;,” but then quickly remembered that nowadays when everything can be saved to the cloud, that justification makes no sense. When I finished organizing, I found that I had left the three phones on my desk, as if they were patiently waiting for me to do something with them. It quickly dawned on me that I actually did not know what to do with them… not from a sentimental perspective, but rather from a lack of knowledge of how to securely dispose of technology. Shouldn’t many of the pieces and parts be reusable to build new devices or maintain old ones? Is there an equivalent to an electronics recycling bin?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Innovator Series: Talking About Online Campaigns for Change with Sotheavy AT</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We recently spoke with Sotheavy AT, the Founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/pg/ThinkPlasticNow/community/&quot;&gt;Think Plastic&lt;/a&gt;, a hugely popular digital environmental advocacy campaign working to reduce plastic waste and inspire action from citizens across Cambodia. (She’s also the former Senior Innovation Program Manager for the DAI-led &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/cambodia-development-innovations&quot;&gt;Development Innovations&lt;/a&gt;, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and a consultant on DAI projects across Southeast Asia.) Think Plastic started small, with two- to three-minute videos in 2019, and has grown rapidly to reach more than 4 million Cambodians in just one year—almost 25 percent of the population of the country. As more businesses, organizations, and citizens go online around the world in the COVID-19 era, we have seen evidence of how well-designed and well-executed online campaigns can rapidly advance development outcomes. Think Plastic has been widely recognized for its success by the Royal Government of Cambodia’s Ministry of Environment and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khmertimeskh.com/50814112/at-sotheavy-award-winning-anti-plastic-pioneer/&quot;&gt;Women of the Future Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt; and is now a well-known brand across the country. This is an excerpt from that interview.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Development for Newbies, Part 2: Sophomore Edition</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This month I’ve been reflecting on all that has happened since this time last year, back when we were still blissfully unaware of the trials, trauma, and transformation 2020 would bring. Instead of focusing on the challenges we faced over the last several months, I’d like to highlight some relevant concepts for colleagues who are gaining momentum in understanding and incorporating digital technologies into their international development work. Below are some important topics (upon which my tech-savvy colleagues and others have written extensively, so check out the links!) that can be applied across our development projects and fieldwork. Consider this the sophomore edition of the “Digital Development for Newbies” series, but if you’re brand new to this topic, I encourage you to start with &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/digital-development-for-newbies-part-1-the-basics.html&quot;&gt;Part 1: The Basics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Are We Reading about Misinformation and Disinformation?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After the insurrection/uprising/riot/attack/craziness/failed coup attempt (take your pick) at the U.S. Capitol building a few weeks ago, misinformation and disinformation are back in the news with a vengeance. While the bulk of the public’s attention has been on U.S. domestic mis/disinfo related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-qanon.html&quot;&gt;QAnon&lt;/a&gt; and other 2020 presidential &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/presidential-election-2020-conspiracy-theories-debunked/&quot;&gt;election conspiracies&lt;/a&gt;, it got us at the Center for Digital Acceleration (CDA) thinking about our favorite websites, blogs, and resources about mis/disinfo in the Global South or specifically for international development practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Towards Inclusive Machine Translation: A Case for User-Centered Design in Machine Learning</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In November 2020, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.masakhane.io/&quot;&gt;Masakhane&lt;/a&gt;, a grassroots natural language process (NLP) community whose “mission is to strengthen and spur NLP in African languages, for Africans, by Africans,” published a paper titled “Participatory Research for Low-resourced Machine Translation: A Case Study in African Languages.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation&quot;&gt;Machine translation&lt;/a&gt; refers to the use of software to translate digital and nondigital text and speech from one language into another. Google Translate is one of the more common examples of machine translation. Most of us have experienced issues translating text, especially sentences and phrases, as Google Translate often has difficulty detecting meaning and context. Due to these challenges, it can often give users incorrect word-for-word translations. (In your free time, search for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GoogleTranslateFail%20&amp;amp;src=typed_query&quot;&gt;#GoogleTranslateFail&lt;/a&gt; hashtag on Twitter for a whole host of mistranslated content and a good laugh.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Translate, and other mainstream machine translation tools, are also limited in the number of languages they are able to translate. As of today, Google Translate offers support for only 108 of the more than 7,000 languages spoken across the globe. Many of the languages that are not supported are what machine learning researchers consider to be “low-resourced,” a term used to describe languages that have few digital resources available and, more importantly, that are less commonly taught, endangered, or low density. The Masakhane paper outlines an alternative “participatory” approach for low-resourced languages to standard NLP tasks such as crowd-sourced annotation for training data and evaluation benchmarks. To learn more about the basics of NLP, head to our previous blog post on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/unearthing-lessons-by-revisiting-not-reinventing-the-wheel-with-data-science.html&quot;&gt;importance of NLP&lt;/a&gt; in development.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Consent to Data Processing in Humanitarian and Development Contexts, Part 2: Beyond Consent</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog is part of a series on the use of management information systems (MIS) in humanitarian crises. In our last piece, we talked about how &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/consent-to-data-processing-in-humanitarian-and-development-contexts-part-one.html&quot;&gt;informed consent&lt;/a&gt; can be difficult in humanitarian settings, but that is not an excuse for failing to protect the privacy of beneficiaries. In this blog, we focus on what to do where consent is not possible.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Racist Hardware and What to Do About It</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2029240&quot;&gt;an astonishing letter&lt;/a&gt; to the editor published in the December 17, 2020, edition of the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; (NEJM), a group of five doctors from the University of Michigan Medical School presented findings from their study on adult inpatients receiving supplemental oxygen at the University’s hospital. They found that the variance between blood oxygen levels measured through a pulse oximeter—an optical device that estimates blood oxygen by analyzing the light absorbed in an extremity, usually a finger—and more rigorous (and invasive) analyses of arterial blood gas differed substantially depending on whether the patient was Black or white. Moreover, Black patients tended to get more optimistic readings from the oximeter. Such inaccuracies could quite possibly lead to worse clinical outcomes and could be particularly detrimental when treating COVID-19 as careful monitoring of patients’ blood oxygen levels can trigger lifesaving medical care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against the backdrop of the ongoing global conversation about racism and bias, one might ask whether the pulse oximeters in this study are racist. Can a piece of hardware even be racist?&lt;/p&gt;
