        <title>Lessons from a School Teacher: 5 Tips for Effective Distance Learning</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the world was catapulted into a socially distant new reality earlier this year, donor-funded development projects have been forced to re-envision what it means to transfer knowledge, build capacity, and implement training for staff, partners, and beneficiaries. As a result, DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration has experienced a swell in requests to support the digital transformation of activities previously envisaged for in-person learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we work to scale support to meet this rising demand, who better to consult on the topic than school teachers? Teachers and students around the world were thrown into distance teaching with little notice and wildly varied levels of preparation. This disruption sparked newfound—but long deserved—teacher accolades from parents suddenly playing an intimate role in their child’s daily learning. Surely anyone with the ability to command a 6-year old’s attention from 30 miles away is worthy of our discipleship. So how did they do it and what did they learn? I spoke with elementary, middle, and high school teachers to glean their insights into engaging learners at a distance. While they had much to share on the matter, what I’ve highlighted below are those takeaways most applicable to the field of international development.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What are User Perceptions of Internet Trust and Privacy in India and Ghana?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a hard couple of years for the internet. Between &lt;a href=&quot;https://intelligence.house.gov/social-media-content/&quot;&gt;election interference&lt;/a&gt; via social media platforms, disinformation going viral and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/FFM-Myanmar/A_HRC_39_64.pdf&quot;&gt;facilitating genocides&lt;/a&gt;, and most recently, the rampant spread of a conspiracy theories that 5G internet broadband caused the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/24/21231085/coronavirus-5g-conspiracy-theory-covid-facebook-youtube&quot;&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, optimism in the internet’s force for good seems shaky at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was scrolling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ictworks.org/tag/twitter/&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; recently and saw a tweet that ironically, mournfully noted, “Remember when this was the platform that was going to save democracy?” I do indeed remember. Simpler times, my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet platforms such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ictworks.org/tag/google/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ictworks.org/tag/facebook/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; have invested immense resources in countering the more nefarious consequences of internet-enabled bad actors, including significant investment in machine-learning capabilities to uproot disinformation and box out cyber criminals before real harm occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These supply-side focused solutions are indeed powerful, scalable tools in the fight against digital harms. However, to date, there has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/the-missing-digital-principle-educate-the-user.html&quot;&gt;less effort&lt;/a&gt; to develop demand-side solutions at scale, such as meaningful, global &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ictworks.org/tag/digital-literacy/&quot;&gt;digital literacy&lt;/a&gt; and regulatory protections for users.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Disinformation and Dating Apps—A Match Made in Heaven (But Swipe Left Though)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Somehow, we have made it to the halfway point of 2020. This year has been &lt;em&gt;wild&lt;/em&gt;, to say the least—&lt;a href=&quot;https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html&quot;&gt;more than 500,000 people&lt;/a&gt; around the world have died due to COVID-19. The murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Riah Milton, Dominique Fells, Oluwatoyin “Toyin” Salau, and quite literally countless other members of the Black community have led to a crisis of conscience and a (sorely needed, long overdue, how-is-this-only-happening-now) reckoning in the United States. In all honesty, I wrote this post about disinformation and dating apps over a month ago. We held it because the light tone wasn’t right for the historical moment we found—and continue to find—ourselves in. I still think it might be too early. However, as my wise friend and colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/authors/gratiana-fu/&quot;&gt;Gratiana Fu&lt;/a&gt; points out, the topic of disinformation is especially relevant, right now, &lt;strong&gt;precisely because&lt;/strong&gt; disinformation about  COVID-19, Black Lives Matter, and many other topics is spreading so quickly. So, with no further ado—enjoy this silly little romp through the world of disinformation on dating apps.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Technology Can Reflect Human Bias—And Resources to Understand It</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With each technological advancement, more decisions in our daily lives are made by algorithms. They increasingly determine what advertisements we see, whether we’re considered for a job, or which books and movies are recommended to us—and how and where law enforcement is deployed in our communities. The ongoing protests to draw attention to, and eradicate, systemic racism in the United States, and in other parts of the world, have made clear something we already knew—humans are biased. Because we are biased, the technology we create is biased, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next several months DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration will explore this topic by trying to answer the following questions (and more) in a new series: How pervasive is algorithmic bias, and which platforms are the worst offenders? (b) How does algorithmic bias work, and how we can tackle it at a technological level? (c) What other responses—policy, digital literacy, and so on—exist to tackle this phenomenon? (d) What are the effects of algorithmic bias on the broader digital development sector?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Importance of Personal Digital Security</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the current climate of data collection and data harvesting by every website, company, government or official body that has access to your browser traffic, usage history, and location, your data is always at risk and vulnerable. To add to this, nothing is absolutely, unequivocally, 100 percent secure. Even air-gapped computers that have no connection to the internet, as demonstrated with the CIA-infected Iranian centrifuges with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/&quot;&gt;Stuxnet&lt;/a&gt; are vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did that sound alarmist? Well, it was meant to be. The good thing is there are simple measures that anyone from web and software developers to computer laypersons can take to protect themselves from the inevitable breach of their data. The more aware we are and the more precautions we take to avoid exposing our “IRL”-selves to the ever-present threats, the better our chances are of staying secure.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>COVID-19 Data Analysis, Part 6: Insights from Forecasting COVID-19 Transmission Rates In Mexico with Google Mobility Data</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This analysis is Part 6 of a series on COVID-19, with a specific focus on Mexico. The analysis will be updated as we receive additional data and the code for all related analysis will be made available shortly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past two months, COVID-19 has made its way beyond the borders of the United States and into other countries of the Americas, namely the second and third largest countries of the region: Brazil and Mexico. While the United States’ daily incidence of deaths slowly declines, Mexico reported its largest daily incidence yet with 1,092 deaths on June 4.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This Week</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear friends and colleagues: we had a lighthearted blog post ready to go this week, but in light of recent events, we’re sure it can wait. Instead, we’re using this time to pause and reflect about the killing of George Floyd and the years of structural racism and inequities that his story represents, both in the U.S. and across the countries where DAI works. We’re also thinking about cities and communities reeling from a combination of a global pandemic and widespread unrest. In the meantime, take care and stay strong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Collaboration: Recommendations from a Six-Week Veteran</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, I have been reading article after article about how to run a successful virtual workshop, training, event, and so on, all of which provided useful advice. But, as I have run my fair share of virtual meetings these days, and because I am often described as “direct” by my peers and colleagues, I thought I would take a stab at making my own list of to-the-point recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Castles Made of Sand: Digital Transformation From the Silicon Up</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Silicon chips are literally black boxes to most of us. We understand that transistors are somehow etched in tiny patterns on these silicon wafers, and that these patterns make possible the computers, phones, and other electronic devices that run our modern world. Digital solutions are built on a foundation of silicon, and the landscape of silicon chip production is changing in ways that could have far-reaching impact on how that foundation is laid, and by whom.&lt;/p&gt;
