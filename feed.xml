        <title>Digital@DAI Year in Review: Top 10 Posts of 2018</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This year Digital@DAI published more than 50 posts, covering everything from women’s entrepreneurship in Cambodia to cyber security for development to smartphone apps for fisheries in Central America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We featured digital experts from organizations such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alabriqu&quot;&gt;John’s Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simprints.com/&quot;&gt;Simprints&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.every1mobile.com/&quot;&gt;Every1Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hotosm.org/&quot;&gt;Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.panoplydigital.com/&quot;&gt;Panoply Digital&lt;/a&gt;, and generated nearly 47,000 page views. The blog continues to explore the potential of digital technology across sectors, geographies, clients, and constituents, reflecting the work that we do. As we continue to engage with all of you—and with the ICT4D community through DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/digital-acceleration&quot;&gt;Center for Digital Acceleration&lt;/a&gt;—our focus on research and products will expand as we continue to ensure that our field-focused  deployments of digital solutions are responsible, inclusive, and dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/digital-at-dai-year-in-review-top-ten-posts-of-2017.html?utm_source=related-box&quot;&gt;final post of 2017&lt;/a&gt; we reviewed the 10 most-read articles of the year. With our audience and total number of blog posts continuing to grow, we now present our top 10 for 2018. These posts showcase a range of topics, content, and writers. Going into 2019, we hope you will connect with us, read the blog, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://confirmsubscription.com/h/r/066AFBA15492935C&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; to Digital@DAI so you don’t miss any updates in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>An Embarrassment of Riches</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Years ago, yours truly was struggling with a major life decision, one that had led to many a sleepless night: Where to go to grad school? I’d been accepted into a number of programs and was agonizing over my options. My dad had graciously taken on the role of my sounding board until one day he blurted out in frustration, “you have an embarrassment of riches, Rachel. Just decide!”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cyber Security Series Part 3: Pirated Software</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been about two months since I last contributed to the Cyber Security Series, but don’t let the time fool you into thinking we haven’t been engaging extensively on the topic. As many of you might remember, the Center for Digital Acceleration (CDA) published the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/digital-inclusion-and-a-trusted-internet.html&quot;&gt;Digital Inclusion and a Trusted Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; report in October on the topic. For those of you who have not read it, I highly recommend it, particularly if you’re interested in cyber security or data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/cybersecurity-series-part-1-trust-is-why-cyber-security-matters-to-digital-development.html?utm_source=related-box&quot;&gt;first post&lt;/a&gt; in this series focused on the issue of trust and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/cyber-security-2.html&quot;&gt;second post&lt;/a&gt; argued that investment in regulations that support the enabling environment, strong institutions, and skills of the population are key to integrating cyber security across a country’s economy. This post focuses on a more micro-level challenge—pirated software—and how addressing it is key to responding to cyber security overall.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Data, Analysis, and Information (Not as Boring as It Sounds)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t excited by the headline—you should be! In this blog I will highlight a few issues I run across when discussing projects or planning data analytics solutions. Going into the details of each of them would take quite some time, so I will keep the anecdotes (data?) brief. There will undoubtedly be many interpretations of the data -&amp;gt; analytics -&amp;gt; insights/information flow, but this blog is simply an opportunity for me to share my own thoughts. After all, what are we as good data stewards and scientists without proper debate?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Powering Women’s Entrepreneurship in Cambodia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/uploads/lida.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;lida.jpg&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; style=&quot;width: 35%;&quot; /&gt;
Meet Lida Loem. Lida is the co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sheinvestments.com/&quot;&gt;SHE Investments&lt;/a&gt;, a social enterprise that helps Cambodian women turn their entrepreneurship skills up to 11 (yes, out of 10) with training, mentorship and networking in both cities and rural regions of Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHE’s vision is a world where investments in women in developing countries are seen as opportunity, not charity. They work with current and aspiring entrepreneurs across Cambodia, and see themselves as a catalyst for women’s economic empowerment through increased income generation and employment opportunities. Their work helps to bridge the gender gap in business and entrepreneurship, strengthening and diversifying Cambodia’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Human-Centered Design for a Digital Farmer Business School Application: A One-Day Roadmap</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Human-centered design (HCD) is a central focus of DAI’s. We’ve written extensively about how we work with our partners to follow this complex and time-consuming (but very important) process and even came up with a more concise, budget-friendly &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/dai-launches-human-centered-design-whitepaper.html&quot;&gt;Lean HCD approach.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of our continued commitment to the approach, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/authors/&quot;&gt;Karim Bin-Humam&lt;/a&gt; and I recently traveled to Ghana to run a workshop on HCD for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ssab-africa.net/&quot;&gt;Sustainable Smallholder Agribusiness Programme (SSAB),&lt;/a&gt; implemented by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was lean HCD on steroids: We asked participants to produce a HCD roadmap in just one day.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Meet the 9 WomenConnect Winners Who Are Using Tech for Good</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Choosing just nine shining examples from more than 500 applicants of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/wcc&quot;&gt;WomenConnect Challenge&lt;/a&gt; was no easy task. The global call—put out in March by Ivanka Trump and USAID Administrator Mark Green—sought examples of the changing ways in which women and girls’ access and use of technology help drive quality health, better education, and improved livelihoods for themselves and their families.&lt;/p&gt;

The cyber training was intended to equip foreign service officers with the knowledge and tools to represent the broad range of policy priorities enumerated in the President’s International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Getting the Basics of ICT4D Right</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a tendency in any field of business (and life!) to focus on the newest, shiniest objects. Just like obsession over the release of the latest iPad, the ICT4D community holds a special place in its heart for the newest technology offerings. Machine learning, blockchain, and the internet of things (IoT) come to mind today, whereas in years past it was crowdsourcing, social media, or smart phones.&lt;/p&gt;
