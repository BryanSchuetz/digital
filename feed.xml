        <title>My Transition from a Tech Company to DAI</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Before joining DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration (CDA), I worked in the software development industry. For the majority of my 15 years in this field, I only worked for tech companies whose main business model was building software. To successfully build software, there are multiple practices and skills that companies need. These skills are, for example, agile methodologies and good coding practices (such as patterns and documentation) that often vary from company to company and the type of technology used. Other practices include daily meetings and specialized resources for each phase of the software development process. In addition, there are roles such as back-end developers, front-end developers, DevOps, scrum masters, graphic designers, UX designers, and more! From this, you can see there is a lot that goes into making even a small web application. But, what I have just described is the experience of working on very large teams that only make software, which is very different from work within CDA’s Products team.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>In Case You Missed It: The Digital Journey in South Asia—Opportunities and Challenges for Small Firms and Women Entrepreneurs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df&quot;&gt;Digital Frontiers&lt;/a&gt; Project, in partnership with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Indo-Pacific Office, recently hosted a thought-provoking webinar featuring views from the field in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal on opportunities and challenges for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and women entrepreneurs in South Asia. Our panel brought together diverse perspectives from experts in government, private sector, and civil society to discuss the key problems faced by SMEs in South Asia today and what the development community can do to break down barriers and help women entrepreneurs take their place as major players in the economy. Missed the discussion? Read the highlights below:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>We Urgently Need to Build Skills to Bolster Trust in Digital Tools</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of last year’s launch events for the DAI Center for Digital Acceleration’s flagship Frontier Insights research on&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/fi-cyber-user-trust-summary.pdf&quot;&gt; user perceptions of trust and privacy on the internet&lt;/a&gt;, two panels of experts helped underscore and widen the discussion around issues raised in the report. In the South Asia panel, a theme that emerged very clearly was the urgent need to build digital skills as a means to develop and maintain trust in digital services. Both the research and expert discussion highlighted the need for a multi-stakeholder approach to enable informed use and trust throughout the digital value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Knowledge Sharing in ICT4D: Beyond Internet Searches and Panel Events</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As we head into “event season”—albeit remotely—I’ve been thinking about how we share knowledge about what we do in the ICT4D space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing some recent research and sector mapping, I noted how different the levels of ICT4D development are amongst various sectors. In digital agriculture, it is generally accepted that there are numerous innovations out there and a plethora of pilot projects, but many are struggling to bring these innovations &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cta.int/en/digitalisation-agriculture-africa&quot;&gt;to scale&lt;/a&gt;. Many programs might be integrating digital as a pilot here and there, but struggling to identify what works and how they can reach the program goals. There are a huge number of initiatives seeking to share lessons within sectors, but how many are taking lessons from sector to sector?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Social Media Storefronts: A Digital Development Blind Spot?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent a lot of my time over the past few months thinking about online shopping. Not only because with the arrival of my second child my Amazon purchases have skyrocketed (although they have), but because DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration has been doing a lot of work alongside our clients digging into how small to medium-size businesses use digital technologies in this digital-forward—often digital-only era of COVID-19. It’s fascinating work and has revealed to me how little I previously knew of social storefronts. My hunch is that many of my peers in digital development are equally unaware of the myriad features, tools, and functions embedded in the business accounts of the ubiquitous social media apps we engage with daily, and we have some work to do to understand, and appropriately utilize, these extremely powerful platforms for economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Beyond Features: Designing for the World’s ‘Digital Explorers’</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent post, former U.K. parliamentarian and current Vice President for Global Affairs and Communications at Facebook, Nick Clegg wrote an extensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://nickclegg.medium.com/you-and-the-algorithm-it-takes-two-to-tango-7722b19aa1c2&quot;&gt;defense&lt;/a&gt; of the company’s role in political polarization and the spread of hate speech, among other contemporary issues. Clegg’s argument is summed up in the title of the piece: “You and the Algorithm: It Takes Two to Tango.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What is Agile? Part One: The Story Behind the Buzzword</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Agile methodology has been a trending topic for a while now and it typically describes a wide range of approaches to software development, project management, and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/bruce_feiler_agile_programming_for_your_family?language=en&quot;&gt;raising children&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone loves to say they work on an agile team or to describe their company as an agile organization. While it’s true that its widespread use has changed the way people work, the details around agile have started to become diluted to the point where no one really knows what it means anymore. The Agile Alliance, an organization that supports those who use Agile, defines it broadly as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/&quot;&gt;the ability to create and respond to change.”&lt;/a&gt; This post is the first in a series aimed at unpacking this buzzword and how the set of ideas it represents can be used effectively in international development contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Five Fresh Tips to Make Digital Safety Cool Again: A Case Study from Thailand</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asia is one of the world’s fastest-growing regions for digital connectivity. Thai people, for example, spend on average nine hours a day using the internet on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationthailand.com/news/30382735&quot;&gt;mobile phones.&lt;/a&gt; That’s the second highest in the world! And 95 percent of all Thais connected to the internet use Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/uploads/Thaniya%201.png&quot; alt=&quot;Thaniya 1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have all heard about the dangers that come with using social media—misinformation, privacy concerns, and cyber bullying—just to name a few. But people in Thailand, like many places around the world, are still very invested in social media platforms, despite the challenges. So how might we turn this challenge into an opportunity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and DAI are collaborating with Facebook Thailand, Love Frankie, a local social change agency, and 400 university students around the country in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/asia-regional/press-releases/feb-9-2021-united-states-promotes-digital-literacy-thailand&quot;&gt;Wai Kid Digital Challenge&lt;/a&gt; to demystify digital safety and citizenship and educate the public about positive online communication, identity and security, news literacy, and critical thinking through creative videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are five fresh tips we have learned from the Challenge so far to make sure your next digital safety activity delivers results.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Going Virtual with Learning</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For some professions, the past year has normalized virtual interactions and digital collaboration. While many jobs and activities still require in-person interaction, others have moved online as much as possible. Conferences are virtual. Weekly meetings take place through a screen. And classrooms have gone online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people who have engaged with learning this past year have had some kind of digital experience. This is true across all ages—and, we have seen, often with mixed success. Nevertheless, at our Center for Digital Acceleration, we know that, as the saying goes—“the show must go on”—and we have done our best to help DAI’s projects around the globe make their in-person courses and activities come alive in our virtual world. In this post, we offer some brief reflections on the different types of online training our projects are developing, and then ask the question: is this the new normal?&lt;/p&gt;
