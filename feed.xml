        <title>Fast Company's World-Changing Ideas Awards Highlight Opportunities for Digital Development</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Fast Company magazine has been around for decades…but is it relevant for digital development work? The publication was founded in 1995 at a time when business was changing the world in new ways. Today, 26 years later, we are still coming to terms with the ways that technologies are transforming the ways we work and live—especially during the COVID-19 global pandemic. As I work with clients and projects focused on digital development, the businesses and organizations featured in Fast Company offer new ideas, inspiration, and out-of-the-box thinking to those of us heads down in global development projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I wanted to share some of the winners of Fast Company’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90623897&quot;&gt;2021 World-Changing Ideas Awards&lt;/a&gt;—and how these innovations could apply to our work. World Changing Ideas is one of Fast Company’s major annual awards programs and is focused on social good, seeking to elevate finished products and brave concepts that make the world better.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Research Explores Digital Technologies and Their Impact on Social Accountability in Southeast Asia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ian Cocroft, Karen Lee, and Connor MacKenzie are second-year master’s students in the international development program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). The SAIS International Development (IDEV) practicum allows students to work directly with public, private, and nongovernmental organizations as a capstone to their graduate studies. Ian, Karen, and Connor worked with the Center for Digital Acceleration at DAI. The students conducted virtual research in Burma, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam during the 2020-21 academic year to better understand how civil society organizations (CSOs) use digital technologies to support social accountability in public service delivery. The team’s final report provides DAI with considerations on how CSOs can better integrate digital technologies into their operations and highlights regional examples of digital tools for social accountability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our practicum team worked with DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration on a regional study about how CSOs in Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam use digital technologies for social accountability in public service delivery, providing a series of recommendations for the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fhi360.org/projects/innovations-social-accountability-cambodia-isac&quot;&gt;Innovations for Social Accountability in Cambodia (ISAC) program&lt;/a&gt;. As part of our research, we undertook an extensive literature review and held Zoom interviews with country representatives from CSOs, tech organizations, and multilateral institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Right to Repair is a Development Issue</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Who owns the device you are reading this blog post on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem like a straightforward question until a power surge fries a key circuit or a stray elbow knocks a unit to the floor. At this point, the process of repairing what you thought was your (or your employer’s) property is likely to get a bit more complicated: The device turns out to be held together with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Proprietary_head&quot;&gt;proprietary screws&lt;/a&gt;, contains deliberately unobtainable spare parts, has software locks that cannot be overridden without the manufacturer’s express permission, or other random features included specifically to seal you out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Apply Now to Support USAID Missions through Digital Agriculture Ecosystem Assessments</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the incredible progress made over the last decade by the U.S. Government’s global hunger and food security &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.feedthefuture.gov/&quot;&gt;Feed the Future&lt;/a&gt; program, continued shocks, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/organization/bureaus/bureau-resilience-and-food-security/responding-to-covid-19-impact-on-resilience-and-food-security&quot;&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, make the work towards a more resilient global population and improved food security more relevant than ever. COVID’s impact on food security continues to be revealed but it’s estimated that 124 million more people experienced long-lasting poverty and hunger in 2020 and that 2.6 million more children will face stunting due to the pandemic. Across the globe, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is working to address these impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Transition from a Tech Company to DAI</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Before joining DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration (CDA), I worked in the software development industry. For the majority of my 15 years in this field, I only worked for tech companies whose main business model was building software. To successfully build software, there are multiple practices and skills that companies need. These skills are, for example, agile methodologies and good coding practices (such as patterns and documentation) that often vary from company to company and the type of technology used. Other practices include daily meetings and specialized resources for each phase of the software development process. In addition, there are roles such as back-end developers, front-end developers, DevOps, scrum masters, graphic designers, UX designers, and more! From this, you can see there is a lot that goes into making even a small web application. But, what I have just described is the experience of working on very large teams that only make software, which is very different from work within CDA’s Products team.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>In Case You Missed It: The Digital Journey in South Asia—Opportunities and Challenges for Small Firms and Women Entrepreneurs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df&quot;&gt;Digital Frontiers&lt;/a&gt; Project, in partnership with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Indo-Pacific Office, recently hosted a thought-provoking webinar featuring views from the field in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal on opportunities and challenges for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and women entrepreneurs in South Asia. Our panel brought together diverse perspectives from experts in government, private sector, and civil society to discuss the key problems faced by SMEs in South Asia today and what the development community can do to break down barriers and help women entrepreneurs take their place as major players in the economy. Missed the discussion? Read the highlights below:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>We Urgently Need to Build Skills to Bolster Trust in Digital Tools</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of last year’s launch events for the DAI Center for Digital Acceleration’s flagship Frontier Insights research on&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/fi-cyber-user-trust-summary.pdf&quot;&gt; user perceptions of trust and privacy on the internet&lt;/a&gt;, two panels of experts helped underscore and widen the discussion around issues raised in the report. In the South Asia panel, a theme that emerged very clearly was the urgent need to build digital skills as a means to develop and maintain trust in digital services. Both the research and expert discussion highlighted the need for a multi-stakeholder approach to enable informed use and trust throughout the digital value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Knowledge Sharing in ICT4D: Beyond Internet Searches and Panel Events</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As we head into “event season”—albeit remotely—I’ve been thinking about how we share knowledge about what we do in the ICT4D space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing some recent research and sector mapping, I noted how different the levels of ICT4D development are amongst various sectors. In digital agriculture, it is generally accepted that there are numerous innovations out there and a plethora of pilot projects, but many are struggling to bring these innovations &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cta.int/en/digitalisation-agriculture-africa&quot;&gt;to scale&lt;/a&gt;. Many programs might be integrating digital as a pilot here and there, but struggling to identify what works and how they can reach the program goals. There are a huge number of initiatives seeking to share lessons within sectors, but how many are taking lessons from sector to sector?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Social Media Storefronts: A Digital Development Blind Spot?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent a lot of my time over the past few months thinking about online shopping. Not only because with the arrival of my second child my Amazon purchases have skyrocketed (although they have), but because DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration has been doing a lot of work alongside our clients digging into how small to medium-size businesses use digital technologies in this digital-forward—often digital-only era of COVID-19. It’s fascinating work and has revealed to me how little I previously knew of social storefronts. My hunch is that many of my peers in digital development are equally unaware of the myriad features, tools, and functions embedded in the business accounts of the ubiquitous social media apps we engage with daily, and we have some work to do to understand, and appropriately utilize, these extremely powerful platforms for economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
