        <title>Headlining, Part I: Spreading Misinformation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve all seen sensational headlines. Whether you find them through Twitter or via a WhatsApp group, headlines such as, “How Scientists got Climate Change So Wrong” (yes, that is a real opinion piece published in 2019 by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/opinion/sunday/science-climate-change.html&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;), are designed to provoke a strong emotional reaction in the reader and leave them with a false impression of reality. And while sensationalism in journalism is &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.state.gov/milestones/1866-1898/yellow-journalism&quot;&gt;not new&lt;/a&gt;, the ongoing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/words-were-watching-infodemic-meaning&quot;&gt;infodemic&lt;/a&gt; combined with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/30/partisan-divides-in-media-trust-widen-driven-by-a-decline-among-republicans/?cid=eml_mtp_20210831&amp;amp;user_email=7d521cec25f1fdf28a23bdd9e6f41570199b371735eac968b93d86fe53c1da2f&amp;amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=New%20Campaign&amp;amp;utm_term=First%20Read&quot;&gt;declining perceptions of trust in news media&lt;/a&gt; and the cementing of social media users into &lt;a href=&quot;https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/digital-media-literacy/what-is-an-echo-chamber/1/&quot;&gt;echo chambers&lt;/a&gt;, creates a perfect storm in which headlining perpetuates misinformation. In this first of a two-part series, I’ll define the phenomenon, explain how headlining differs from “fake news,” and discuss five ways to spot and not fall victim to headlining.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Gaming Trends Offer Applications for International Development</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever suffered the consequences of someone else’s online gaming habits? Maybe it was your college roommate playing World of Warcraft mere hours before your 8am exam, your partner choosing Call of Duty over date night, or your child’s “hidden” Candy Crush play under the dinner table as you tried to ask about their day. It is not unheard of for frequent gaming to negatively affect one’s ability to focus, productivity at work, or social relationships. In fact, in 2018, the World Health Organization even recognized “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news/item/14-09-2018-inclusion-of-gaming-disorder-in-icd-11&quot;&gt;gaming disorder&lt;/a&gt;” among the addictive disorders included in its 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases. Disorders are classified when the associated pattern of behavior results in significant distress or impairment in “personal, family, social, educational, or occupational functioning.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>RFP: Funding Available for Solutions that Address Gender Inequity in AI Technology</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the use of artificial intelligence (AI) proliferates, more instances of the inequitable design, use, and impact of AI-enabled tools in developing countries are coming to light. Many of these tools and approaches have the capacity for inequitable outcomes across genders due to humans unconsciously embedding bias in AI technology during data collection, model design or end-use applications. As a result, these tools often pose the greatest risk of harm and missed opportunities to those already marginalized in low- and middle-income countries. To foster an equitable and inclusive digital ecosystem, more efforts are needed to identify innovative and creative approaches to help decision-makers address actual and potential gender biases and inequitable outcomes resulting from AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Multi-Country Research Explores MSME Digital Tool Use in Emerging Markets Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As we approach the second year mark of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world continues to reflect on the stark realities the crisis has forced us all to acknowledge, including key drivers of economic resilience for individual businesses. As countries take steps toward economic stabilization, it is clear that micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs)—which account for two-thirds of employment globally and between 80 and 90 percent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://unctad.org/news/supporting-small-businesses-critical-covid-19-recovery&quot;&gt;employment in low-income countries&lt;/a&gt;—play an essential role in strengthening pandemic recovery efforts. The pandemic has also revealed the vital role digital technologies play in enabling businesses, communities, and individuals to connect, function, and thrive. Ensuring that MSMEs can access digital tools is particularly crucial in emerging markets because MSMEs fuel economic growth and spur &lt;a href=&quot;https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/25851MSMEs_and_SDGs_Final3120.pdf&quot;&gt;job creation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>GIS Data: Availability and Applicability, Part 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is an understatement to say that data are often imperfect. There are often holes, missing pieces that always seem to be precisely the required piece to cement the foundation of your carefully crafted research question. The process of massaging that research question will not be covered here, but data exploration is pivotal in discovering what is available and what is applicable, especially so when it comes to the spatial components of datasets. Hopefully, the following information will help you in the future when looking for data or deciding which spatial data to use to augment or drive your research.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Location-Based Platform Work Presents Benefits—and Risks—to Workers in the Global South, Part 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the wonders of the digital age is that if at 11 pm I suddenly crave a pizza (Hawaiian preferably—no shame!), all I have to do is click a few buttons on my phone, and &lt;em&gt;voila!&lt;/em&gt; pizza is delivered to my door. While it may feel like the pizza arrived by magic, especially given the “no-contact” options made available since the start of COVID-19, the satisfaction of my late-night craving is made possible by the work of independent contractors hired by digital platforms such as Uber and DoorDash to deliver products in cities around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Apply Now: Support USAID and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on an Assessment of Farmer-Centric Models of Data Governance and Ownership</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the number of digitally enabled agricultural products and services continues to grow in regions across the globe, most of the data collected by the digital service providers developing these tools remain locked within each entity’s systems. Due to incomplete, fragmented, or non-existent data sets on agri-food system stakeholders, such as farmers, digital service providers often take on the cost burden of collecting the information they need to develop products and services for their target users. This results in multiple actors holding fragments of information on agri-food system actors, decreasing incentives for data sharing across organizations and increasing the burden placed on food system actors to repeatedly provide their data to numerous researchers, companies, and development organizations. This dynamic has led to several missed opportunities for all stakeholders, including government agencies, the private sector, and the development community, to have a common and complete picture of the state of agricultural communities and the needs of individual actors therein.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Future is Looking Up: Satellites for Development</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When predicting which technologies might have an impact on international development in the coming years, shifts in the economics of a technology are often more indicative of impending transformation than improvements in its capabilities. Particularly in emerging markets, even older technologies can suddenly become disruptive once their cost drops, enabling wider application. With that lens in our spyglass as we scan the horizon for coming opportunities, then, we should not forget to look up, because satellites are getting radically cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Study Shows Most Costa Rican Companies Depend on U.S.-Based Tech Platforms to Sell Goods or Services</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Like much of the developing world, Costa Rica has limited availability of digital technologies compared to industrialized nations. Due to this lag in digital transformation, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, commerce in Costa Rica was highly affected, leading to business disruption and unemployment. As of June, the country’s unemployment rate was 17.4 percent, which is an improvement upon the initial losses in 2020, however, still higher than the average for high-income countries (6.4 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As COVID-19 stretches into its second year, formal companies, both big and small, are jumping into the digital world to find efficient and safe ways to offer their services and products online. Informal businesses are following suit, using online platforms to reach customers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout this past summer, DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration has been working with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sesameworkshop.org/what-we-do/refugee-response&quot;&gt;Sesame Workshop&lt;/a&gt; on its Play to Learn program to explore the possibilities for using digital tools to provide education services among children, ages 3 to 8, living in crisis-affected communities.&lt;/p&gt;
