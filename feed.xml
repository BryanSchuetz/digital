        <title>Plan C: How Makerspaces are Providing a Stopgap for COVID-19 Supply Shortages</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the participants in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.development-innovations.org/success-stories/think-global-make-local-3d-printing-propels-young-cambodians-future/&quot;&gt;Think Global Make Local&lt;/a&gt; product development workshop, sponsored by our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/cambodia-development-innovations&quot;&gt;Cambodia Development Innovations&lt;/a&gt; project in 2016, created a design for a toy called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Doydoycompany/&quot;&gt;Doy Doy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. With &lt;em&gt;Doy Doy’s&lt;/em&gt; silicone straws and plastic connectors, kids can build complex structures. The product has gone on to achieve modest commercial success locally. I found &lt;em&gt;Doy Doy&lt;/em&gt; instructive because of the way its creator, Em Chanrithykol, ended up manufacturing the toy’s plastic connectors. Because of a lack of local injection-molding capacity and administrative barriers to importing parts made by contract manufacturers outside of Cambodia, Chanrithykol turned to a less traditional method: He contracted a local firm to churn out the parts on a battery of 3D printers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3D printing is slow, expensive, and inefficient. It is great for small runs of one-off items or prototypes, but it is a terrible way to mass manufacture a product. But the lesson of &lt;em&gt;Doy Doy&lt;/em&gt; is that a bad way to mass manufacture a product can still be better than having &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; way to mass manufacture a product. This is why I am currently manufacturing personal protective face shields for Baltimore-area hospitals in my basement.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Importance of Understanding Digital Divides During the COVID-19 Response</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Our work at DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration intersects with global COVID-19 responses in many ways. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/covid-19-data-analysis-part-1-demography-behavior-and-environment.html&quot;&gt;Earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, our data scientists presented an analysis of risk factors and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/COVID-looking-for-the-helpers-in-the-hardware-community.html&quot;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; we got a glimpse at the hardware community’s approach to the crisis. There is another element to our work that I think is critical to highlight—digital ecosystem assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>COVID-19 Data Analysis, Part 1: Demography, Behavior, and Environment</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was written by DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/authors/gratiana-fu/&quot;&gt;Gratiana Fu&lt;/a&gt;, with contributions from &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/authors/greg-maly/&quot;&gt;Greg Maly&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-parr-4a534897/&quot;&gt;Jamie Parr&lt;/a&gt;. This analysis is Part 1 of a series on known risk factors associated with COVID-19. We aim to use publicly available data sets to identify national and subnational populations most at risk for infection and case fatality. The analysis will be updated as we receive additional data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>COVID-19: Looking for Helpers in the Hardware Community</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the COVID-19 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/11/health/coronavirus-pandemic-world-health-organization/index.html&quot;&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt; makes its way across the globe, and even well-resourced health systems struggle with the availability of critical supplies needed to treat patients, initiatives have emerged in the hardware community looking to help solve the shortage of physical supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unlocking the Value of Digital Transformation in the Social Sector</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For many years, the support of international donors to civil society organizations and private and public sectors in the technology field revolved around the provision of equipment, hardware, and software. On many occasions, these types of support have proved ineffective. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261263057_Overcoming_ICT_project_failures_-_A_practical_perspective&quot;&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; wrote in 2013, these investments quickly became obsolete or abandoned. Since then, we in the digital development community have supported international donors and international programming to better integrate technology into our work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Closing the Gender Digital Divide: What We’re Doing to Bring Women Online</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Digital technologies are revolutionizing the way we access information, financing, and networks—all critical tools for fully participating in the global economy. Yet, these technologies, most notably internet connectivity and mobile phones, are not reaching all people equally. In recognition of International Women’s Day, we are looking at one of the most pressing barriers women face to their economic advancement—the gender digital divide—and how DAI is addressing this problem through the U.S. Agency for International Development’s W-GDP&lt;a href=&quot;https://womenconnectchallenge.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/newsletter_final.pdf&quot;&gt; WomenConnect Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, implemented by DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df&quot;&gt;Digital Frontiers&lt;/a&gt; project. (For the latest information, please read our most recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://womenconnectchallenge.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/newsletter_final.pdf&quot;&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What are Cyber Harms and Why Are They Important for Digital Development?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, the digital landscape has significantly changed globally. First, and most obvious, the number of internet users has nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/273018/number-of-internet-users-worldwide/&quot;&gt;doubled&lt;/a&gt; from 2.8 billion to more than 4 billion in the last six years. Second, and perhaps a bit less obvious, the number of cyber incidents, such as data breaches or cybercrimes, impacting the average internet user, has grown exponentially. For a while now, I’ve been thinking about what these cybersecurity trends mean for our work in digital development. I recently read an article that helped frame the challenge in a way that is easily digestible, even by the least digitally focused development expert.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using Social Media to Build Community (and Advance Project Goals)—Tips and Tricks from Development Innovations</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For those of us who follow the tech world, big tech has &lt;a href=&quot;https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/what-its-like-to-own-an-amazon-ring-doorbell-camera.html&quot;&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126970/apple-iphone-independent-repair-contract-search-audit&quot;&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/6ec3f6a6-4d56-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-why-facebook-agreed-to-pay-550-million-privacy-settlement-to-illinois-2020-02-09&quot;&gt;press&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/microsoft-accidentally-exposed-250-million-customer-support-records-online-heres-what-you-should-know.html&quot;&gt;lately&lt;/a&gt;. Even development practitioners have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ictworks.org/facebook-digital-development/#.Xkq6_ihKg2y&quot;&gt;getting in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.devex.com/news/what-the-facebook-scandal-means-for-data-for-good-92425&quot;&gt;on the game&lt;/a&gt;. However, I like to keep things interesting—so here is a positive story about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; helping catalyze a community of innovators in Cambodia on the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.development-innovations.org/&quot;&gt;Development Innovations (DI)&lt;/a&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What's the Best Architecture for a Management Information System?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I hate to say it, but it depends. Generally though, I do have an opinion, and while your mileage may vary, I think one model might often better serve more use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, you might think our products team only builds full-stack web applications. That is only half our story. We also spend a significant time providing technical advice to DAI project staff and their government counterparts on the technology solutions they are looking to procure. I call this &lt;em&gt;translating:&lt;/em&gt; taking the needs and requirements of the project and explaining it in technical terms to developers and IT experts. One common area we help project staff understand, update, or integrate is a management information system (MIS) in disparate and un-harmonized contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What the Food Systems Dashboard Taught Me About Data for Decision Making</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I began working with DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration, I have had the chance to explore many of the exciting opportunities presented by our quickly digitizing world. Though I spend most of my time researching how digital tools and service platforms impact economic empowerment and productivity in the agriculture sector, an area that I am eager to explore further is the role of data in policy and decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
