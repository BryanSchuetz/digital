        <title>Improving Digital Literacy and Security Training In Cambodia: Suggestions for Funders, Training Providers, and Content Creators</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maura Joul, Annie Kemmerer, Baker Lu, and Billy Taki are second-year master’s students in the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) international development program. They worked with DAI on the Innovations for Social Accountability in Cambodia (ISAC) project, implemented by FHI 360 and funded by U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), to conduct a landscape assessment of digital literacy and security education and training initiatives in Cambodia. The team interviewed digital security consultants, content creators, training providers, local civil society organizations (CSOs), international organizations, and industry experts in Cambodia. This post summarizes their key findings and recommendations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSOs in Cambodia are experiencing rapid changes in response to COVID-19. The pandemic forced Cambodian citizens served by CSOs into the digital world, leading these organizations to shift their communications and programming to virtual platforms. Although Cambodian CSOs successfully aclimated to the rapid digitalization, the move to virtual has increased digital security issues in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Literacy Series: Closing the Gap for Semi-Literate and Illiterate Populations</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Center for Digital Acceleration &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dai-global-digital.com/digital-literacy-series-the-digcomp-framework.html&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=docs&amp;amp;ust=1658146562000797&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3j9jpbm928yigZBp2zwbhX&quot;&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; a series dedicated to digital literacy in international development. We want to learn more about this nuanced topic because digital literacy is central to sustaining the rapid digitalization that has taken place over the last two years. As donors, implementing partners, private companies, and government agencies invest in the digital transformation of key sectors and services, practitioners must prioritize helping the communities interact with digital technology “&lt;a href=&quot;https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC128415&quot;&gt;confidently, critically, and safely.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, I’ve had the pleasure of learning how international development projects can achieve this goal. While conducting research for the U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/digital-literacy-primer&quot;&gt;Digital Literacy Primer&lt;/a&gt;, I learned how important it is to design digital literacy activities that meet users where they are. A university student looking for an office job, a government official expected to adhere to new cybersecurity policies, and a farmer looking to use his mobile phone to diagnose crop diseases all have different contexts and needs that will shape how a practitioner supports a digital literacy journey. Recognizing the importance of developing unique strategies to serve these unique user groups, one question lingers in my mind: How can we support digital literacy among users who are not literate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we dive in, are you new to the concept of digital literacy? If so, I highly recommend reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/digital-literacy-series-the-digcomp-framework.html&quot;&gt;first post&lt;/a&gt; of this series to learn more about the concept and how frameworks such as the European Union DigComp Framework can help development practitioners categorize the skills, knowledge, and attitudes needed to develop digital literacy. Another recent post, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dai-global-digital.com/defining-and-exploring-digital-literacy-in-digital-development.html&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=docs&amp;amp;ust=1658146562000292&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1KCoAHF1nIj1Q2nGOCPyLn&quot;&gt;“Defining and Exploring Digital Literacy in Digital Development,”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is also a helpful resource that shares how USAID defines digital literacy and how the USAID-funded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df&quot;&gt;Digital Frontiers&lt;/a&gt; program is incorporating digital literacy activities throughout its portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Embracing the Unlikely Resilience of Feature Phones</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of us in the development sector have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.worldbank.org/digital-development/mobile-based-solutions-can-strengthen-human-capital-gains-disrupted-covid-19&quot;&gt;preparing&lt;/a&gt; for an inevitable and imminent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldbank.org/en/events/2021/06/10/using-smartphones-to-strengthen-the-human-capital-of-online-and-offline-populations-new-evidence-and-collaborations-for-&quot;&gt;smartphone&lt;/a&gt; future. But in a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60763168&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, the BBC highlighted an interesting—if somewhat unexpected—phenomenon in the world of digital devices: the “return of the dumbphones” (we prefer the less pejorative term “feature phones,” which we use in this piece). According to the article, “While sales figures are hard to come by, one report said that global purchases of [feature phones] were due to hit one billion units last year, up from 400 million in 2019. This compares to worldwide sales of 1.4 billion smartphones last year, following a 12.5 percent decline in 2020.” Some might argue that the feature phone has never really gone away.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>4 Critical Considerations When Developing ICT Policies and Regulations</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a world dominated by rapid innovation, information and communications technology (ICT) is not only an accelerator for economic growth, it also provides on-ramps for vulnerable populations to participate in society and not get left behind. However, the potential of this type of tech can only go as far as a nation’s regulatory environment allows. A weak regulatory environment can drastically limit the benefits of ICT for a country’s economy, consumers, and citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Flagged for Review: A Look at Hate Speech in the International Development Context</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many countries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globesmart.com/blog/celebrating-lgbt-pride-around-the-world-things-to-know/&quot;&gt;around the world&lt;/a&gt; recognize June as Pride Month—a time to celebrate lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people, while reflecting on the community’s history. But this year it’s not just sunshine and rainbows. In cyberspace, the discourse about LGBTQ people and their rights is increasingly crowded with hate speech. On any given day, my own Twitter feed is sprinkled with posts arguing that LGBTQ people are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2022/05/11/1096623939/accusations-grooming-political-attack-homophobic-origins&quot;&gt;“grooming”&lt;/a&gt; children, claiming &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/1536667667150651392?s=21&quot;&gt;same-sex couples&lt;/a&gt; shouldn’t be represented in Disney movies, or attacking the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/anti-lgbtq-threats-orchestrated-on-internet-shut-down-events-rcna33955&quot;&gt;validity and humanity&lt;/a&gt; of transgender people. While I find these messages deeply distressing, I’m forced to ask myself, “Is this hate speech?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I’m going to use the example of LGBTQ hate speech to lay out what hate speech is, link it to the international development context, and explore what social media platforms and other stakeholders are doing to combat hate speech.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>USAID Launches Digital Government Model</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2021, as people around the world—and their governments—were grappling with a rapid transition to digital technology, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalfrontiersdai.com/&quot;&gt;Digital Frontiers&lt;/a&gt; project began working with the Technology Division of USAID’s Innovation, Technology, and Research (ITR/T) Hub to create a conceptual model of digital government, or e-government. That model is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/digital-government-model&quot;&gt;live&lt;/a&gt; and available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Literacy Series: The DigComp Framework</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With the onset of the pandemic spurring ever-faster digitalization around the world, we at DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration are thinking about the key elements needed to ensure sustainable digital transformation in the countries where we work. One of the primary building blocks needed to achieve sustainability is strengthening digital literacy. As digital development practitioners, digital literacy is a big part of our work. Whether a person is getting online for the first time or is a cyber specialist, we have a responsibility to ensure those we work with have the agency to use the appropriate technology meaningfully: to achieve professional and personal goals, while avoiding digital harm. We also have a responsibility to close the digital divide by supporting novices in developing basic skills, so they are not left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Four Awardees Are Paving the Way for a More Equitable AI-Powered Future</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;introducing-the-winners-of-usaids-equitable-ai-challenge&quot;&gt;Introducing the Winners of USAID’s Equitable AI Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are a dual-edged sword: they promise tremendous benefits for international development, but have also demonstrated instances of bias and harm, often resulting from inequitable design, use, and impact. Recognizing that AI technologies can cause gender biases, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) urgently looked for innovative and creative approaches to address gender-inequitable outcomes by launching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ictworks.org/gender-equitable-artificial-intelligence-outcomes/#.YnPvuejMKUl&quot;&gt;Equitable AI Challenge&lt;/a&gt; in the fall of 2021. This challenge, implemented through DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df&quot;&gt;Digital Frontiers&lt;/a&gt;, sought to support approaches that increase the accountability and transparency of AI systems in global development contexts. Dozens of competitors submitted approaches related to the prevention, identification, or monitoring of bias and harm against women and gender-nonconforming people—reflecting the larger goals of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/usaid-digital-strategy&quot;&gt;USAID’s Digital Strategy&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/oct-26-2021-administrator-samantha-power-first-ever-national-strategy-gender&quot;&gt;National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality&lt;/a&gt;, and the recently launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/artificial-intelligence-action-plan&quot;&gt;USAID AI Action Plan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Drone Mapping Reflects Solid Waste and Ocean Plastic Impact of the Durban Floods</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Heavy downpours over only two days in April 2022 caused South Africa’s worst and most deadly natural disaster to date: a flash flood so rare and devastating it has a one in the 300-year probability of recurring. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://erccportal.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ECHO-Products/Echo-Flash#/daily-flash-archive/4474&quot;&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 435 people died and up to 41,000 people were affected. Rescue and disaster response efforts, which began immediately, are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
