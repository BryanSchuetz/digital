        <title>Getting Subnational: Combining Large Scale Surveys with Geospatial Data to Produce Better Small Area Estimation (Part I)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Collecting granular location data on key socioeconomic indicators for strategic planning is an increasingly important topic in international development. Given the limitations of national-level data, many analysts and policymakers now focus on obtaining subnational data to identify pockets of poverty in a country, select priority sites for poverty alleviation programs, establish subnational benchmarks for monitoring and evaluation purposes, and cross-validate data collected by country governments on indicators such as child mortality and basic literacy rates.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog is part of the WomenConnect Challenge (WCC) Blog Series: Introducing Strategies for Closing the Gender Digital Divide. The U.S. Agency for International Development &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.womenconnectchallenge.org/&quot;&gt;WomenConnect Challenge (WCC)&lt;/a&gt; is a global call for solutions to improve women’s participation in everyday life by meaningfully changing the ways women access and use technology.

&lt;p&gt;It is no revelation that the global economy has been permanently digitized. Now, the internet is not just “the marketplace of ideas” but also the world’s largest marketplace of commodities, crafts, and services. Exclusion from this vast and dynamic market limits one’s opportunities in countless ways—socially and economically. Across the world, many women are unable to engage with the digital economy, and many “real life” economic opportunities—even those traditionally available to women—are moving online, rendering them inaccessible and necessitating new approaches to development.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Trade in Southern Africa: How Firms Have Adapted to Digital Trade During COVID-19</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, companies in Southern Africa—like elsewhere in the world—have been forced to adapt to remote working: moving their business and communications online, conducting virtual business to business (B2B) meetings, and attending online trade expos and webinars. Between September and December 2021, DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration worked with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.satihub.com/&quot;&gt;USAID Southern Africa Trade and Investment Hub&lt;/a&gt; (USAID TradeHub) to understand how these businesses have adapted, what the long-term effects of the pandemic might be, and the support that firms need to adapt to the new normal. During this study, we spoke to three types of firms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exporters:&lt;/strong&gt; A firm—in the case of the USAID TradeHub, in Southern Africa—that sells its goods to a market other than its national domestic market.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buyers&lt;/strong&gt;: An entity (firm, person, or association) that purchases goods from a vendor—in the case of the USAID TradeHub, the vendor is an exporter from the Southern African region. These firms may be based in the region or in the United States.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trade promotion service providers (TPSPs):&lt;/strong&gt; An organization (public or private) that provides services to assist firms to trade—and in many cases, export—their products. Services include supporting firms to meet market entry and buyer requirements, supporting trade investment events where firms showcase their products and meet buyers, identifying demand and potential buyers and creating mutually beneficial relationships between exporters and buyers for long-term business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>The Path to a Sustained Network for Women Entrepreneurs in South Asia: Insights from the SARDI Strengthening Women in Tech Symposium</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you take your chai or coffee? These opening words welcomed participants from all around the world for the South Asia Regional Digital Initiative (SARDI) Strengthening Symposium, a series of conversations about the most pressing barriers to investment in women-owned enterprises. Covering tremendous ground in 10 hours over four days, this virtual event connected finalists for potential partnerships, inspired applicants by clearly articulating the goals of the activity, and strengthened phase two applications in the process for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/apply-now-strengthening-women-in-tech-in-south-asia.html&quot;&gt;Strengthening Women in Tech in South Asia&lt;/a&gt; Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This SARDI initiative, implemented under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/digital-connectivity-and-cybersecurity-partnership/&quot;&gt;Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership (DCCP),&lt;/a&gt;aims to address barriers for women entrepreneurs seeking to expand their business by connecting women across the region for peer-learning opportunities, providing mentorship, investment, and capacity-building support, and building awareness around the ICT policy environment that governs their businesses. The finalists participating in the symposium, ranging from large international organizations to consortia made up of local accelerators and industry associations, are in the running to ultimately design and implement this important regional network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SARDI designed the symposium to bring together the best and brightest, selecting the top 10 out of more than 40 applicants.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WomenConnect Challenge Blog Series: Strategy 1 — Changing Social Norms and Cultural Perceptions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog is part of the WomenConnect Challenge (WCC) Blog Series: Introducing Strategies for Closing the Gender Digital Divide. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.womenconnectchallenge.org/&quot; title=&quot;https://www.womenconnectchallenge.org/&quot;&gt;WomenConnect Challenge (WCC)&lt;/a&gt; is a global call for solutions to improve women’s participation in everyday life by meaningfully changing the ways women access and use technology. In the first round, WCC awarded nine grants to organizations working to identify and change the social and economic circumstances that keep women offline and under-empowered. Through close partnership with local awardee teams and community members, WCC has identified &lt;a href=&quot;https://womenconnectchallenge.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/proven_strategies_digitalgenderdivide_final.pdf&quot;&gt;five proven strategies&lt;/a&gt; for closing the gender digital divide and increasing women’s empowerment. This blog explores one strategy at length.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It can lead to stealing. Or promiscuous activities, drug abuse, rudeness, stubbornness, lies… 90 percent of the causes of immorality, bad behavior, attitudes of urban women are related to the internet.” This was one man’s justification for restricting his female family members from using the internet and mobile phones. “The internet will destroy their good upbringing and morality,” declared another young man. “We feel that the phone is a simple way to destroy a woman’s morality and alter her thoughts,” agreed yet another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When WCC grantee&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.equalaccess.org/our-work/projects/closing-the-gender-digital-divide-tech4families/&quot;&gt; Equal Access International (EAI)&lt;/a&gt; began its #Tech4Families program in northern Nigeria, baseline interviews were rife with this idea that women’s use of the internet and digital technologies would lead to their moral decline. At the baseline, 80 percent of men and boys interviewed did not believe the internet could be beneficial for women and girls, citing women’s use of digital technologies as immoral, inappropriate, or unnecessary. Many female interviewees echoed the sentiments of their male counterparts, perhaps having internalized the negative gender norms or fearing community backlash.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Global Insights from a Major New Study on MSME Digital Tool Use in Emerging Markets Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented economic slowdown that had an outsized, adverse &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intracen.org/uploadedFiles/intracenorg/Content/Publications/ITCSMECO2020.pdf&quot;&gt;impact&lt;/a&gt; on micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) across the globe. As the world begins to reckon with the ‘new normal’ and countries take steps toward economic stabilization, it is clear that MSMEs—which account for two-thirds of employment globally and 80 to 90 percent of employment in &lt;a href=&quot;https://unctad.org/news/supporting-small-businesses-critical-covid-19-recovery&quot;&gt;low-income countries&lt;/a&gt;—will play an essential role in strengthening pandemic recovery efforts as they fuel economic growth and spur &lt;a href=&quot;https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/25851MSMEs_and_SDGs_Final3120.pdf&quot;&gt;job creation&lt;/a&gt; in emerging markets. The pandemic also revealed the vital role digital technologies play in enabling businesses, communities, and individuals to connect, function, and thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
