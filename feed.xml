        <title>Digital Insights: Would Haitians use Mobile Money for Banking?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In late September, I traveled to Haiti to conduct research on how Haitians engage with financial institutions and mobile technology to explore the feasibility of introducing mobile money as an avenue for the provision of financial services. Together with the team from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/haiti-finance-inclusive-fininc&quot;&gt;USAID/Haiti Finance Inclusive project&lt;/a&gt;, implemented by DAI, and with support from our sister USAID/Haiti project Finance Pour Tous and two key credit unions—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/CPFRATERNITE/&quot;&gt;Caisse Populaire Fraternite (CPF)&lt;/a&gt; and Socolavim—I visited nine locations through the northern and central provinces of the country to interview 181 credit union customers as they went about their business.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why a Dashboard Isn’t Just a Dashboard</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I distinctly remember an early conversation with colleagues when I began working in digital development in which a peer dismissively waved his hand at the idea of implementing a live data dashboard, saying “A dashboard is a dashboard is a dashboard!” The finality of that line stuck with me. I assumed that the dismissal came from a person who was bored with dashboards, like a kid who opens a birthday present to find he has received yet ANOTHER dashboard. Well, interactive data dashboards—just like automobile dashboards—may not be the newest, hottest, shiniest thing in the ICT4D toolbox, but they’re still important and their often hidden values go unappreciated by many.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>8 Do’s and Don’ts in Adaptive Management and Learning in ICT4D</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a guest post by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/kate-heuisler&quot;&gt;Kate Heuisler&lt;/a&gt;, Chief of Party of DAI’s USAID-funded Cambodia Development Innovations project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.development-innovations.org/&quot;&gt;Development Innovations&lt;/a&gt; supports innovators and boosts the use of information and communication technologies for the overall development of Cambodia. The project is structured to be flexible and adaptive—because we need to. Really, most creative development programs &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; build themselves to be learning organizations, to be ready for big pivots, regardless if you and your partners use digital innovations. The development world is regularly disrupted—by political changes, natural disasters, new technologies such as social media—and is no longer built for static, five-year plans. Donors and funders need partners that can learn by doing, and are not afraid to adapt strategies and implementation plans to continually improve.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>GeekFest 2017: Delving into Public Access with Duduzile Mkhwanazi of Project Isizwe</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/geek%20fest%20smallest.jpg?download&quot; alt=&quot;geek fest logo&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; /&gt;
Welcome to GeekFest 2017, a series of interviews featuring ICT4D thought leaders. Our goals for #geekfest2017 are: to highlight the people and organizations who are pushing the field in new directions, to feature their work and show how it’s different or new, and to support the overall growth of the ICT4D community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we are focusing on public access as a solution to closing the Digital Divide. Being able to access free public wifi can be crucial for those who cannot afford internet subscriptions: It can be the difference between finally finding that job, getting the training you need or linking up with a valuable investor for your new venture. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://a4ai.org/affordability-report/report/2017/&quot;&gt;2017 A4AI  Affordability Report&lt;/a&gt; noted the importance of public wifi for engendering use of the internet: Research shows public wifi as one of the most popular options for online access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat down with Duduzile Mkhwanazi, CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.projectisizwe.org/&quot;&gt;Project Isizwe&lt;/a&gt;-an organization making great strides in providing free public wifi in South Africa, a country where inequality is rife and the affordability of mobile data is just out of reach for many, despite &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mobileconnectivityindex.com/#year=2016&amp;amp;zoneIsocode=ZAF&quot;&gt;99 percent 3G coverage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Practicing the Principles for Digital Development in East Africa</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a guest post by Mustapha Issa, Field Manager and MAST Coordinator and Gilead Mushaija, GIS Database Specialist, both from DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/tanzania-feed-future-tanzania-land-tenure-assistance-lta&quot;&gt;Feed the Future Land Tenure Assistance project.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/practicing-the-principles-for-digital-development-in-east-africa-tickets-37822273438&quot;&gt;Practicing the Principles for Digital Development&lt;/a&gt; event on October 12 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, 80 participants from organizations including DAI, the Ministry of Works, Transport, and Communications, and private organizations from Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda attended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalimpactalliance.org/&quot;&gt;Digital Impact Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (DIAL) and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hdif-tz.org/&quot;&gt;Human Development Innovation Fund Tanzania&lt;/a&gt; (HDIF-UKAid) stewarded the event and were joined by leading organizations in endorsing the Digital Principles. DAI is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalprinciples.org/endorse/endorsers/&quot;&gt;signatory to the Principles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Three Key Takeaways from USAID’s New Gender and ICT Survey Toolkit</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This past week USAID’s Global Development Lab and mStar project released the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/15396/Gender_and_ICT_Toolkit.pdf&quot;&gt;Gender and ICT Survey Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;. In an informative webinar (you can listen to the recording &lt;a href=&quot;http://solutionscenter.nethope.org/webinars/view/introducing-usaids-gender-and-ict-toolkit&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), the team that produced the report discussed both the content and the context surrounding the genesis of the toolkit. I tuned in and spent the majority of the time silently cheering, thrilled to hear USAID promoting research tactics and information needs that align with what we on DAI’s ICT team are doing with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=digital-insights&quot;&gt;Digital Insights&lt;/a&gt; work. In between cheers, I feverishly took notes and captured these three key takeaways.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Testing Data Collection with OpenDataKit</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Primary data collection: One of the most challenging, but necessary, components of any research project. Mobile and browser-based technologies have revolutionized the speed and efficiency of collecting data, enabling teams to work together on a centralized database without the headache of managing paper forms, or multiple excel documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this article, it’s likely you’ve used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/forms/about/&quot;&gt;Googleforms&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surveymonkey.com/&quot;&gt;Survey Monkey&lt;/a&gt; for your work. But what if you need to collect data in regions without 3G or LTE coverage? You’ll need a tool to manage offline data collection, and load the data once you access a wireless internet connection. Fortunately, there are several tools designed to do just that, and one of them is completely free and open source. It’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://opendatakit.org/&quot;&gt;OpenDataKit&lt;/a&gt; (ODK). Let’s take a look at how this technology works.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open Innovation in 60 Minutes or Less</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When we do “open innovation,” it’s essential to define the problem we are trying to solve. And crucial to that process is crafting a good “Call.”  Can this be done in 60 minutes or less?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Second Chance Fund: Learning and Iteration with Tech in Cambodia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Any honest digital designer will admit it: Most tech tools fail. At least the first time around. Getting your users to drop the old way of doing things and use your new website (or gadget, or app) isn’t easy. It doesn’t matter if it visualizes their transactions in some really clever way, or sends their user data to the cloud for real-time analysis, or even if it saves them time or money. Behavior change is difficult, and doubly so when you’re designing across cultures. Why? A few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Investments in Internet Access Must Include Investments in “Critical Digital Literacy”</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Expanding internet access in ‘last-mile markets’ is a priority for development agencies—and rightly so. The economic costs to countries that do not offer their populations internet access is high: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canback.com/files/2014_Offline_and_falling_behind_Barriers_to_Internet_adoption.pdf&quot;&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have detailed the internet’s macroeconomic boost to GDP, the economic and employment benefits of the growth in the digital sector, and the impact of ICT on small business revenue and job creation. Internet access has also been shown to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2016&quot;&gt;improve learning and health&lt;/a&gt; outcomes and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ie/Documents/TechnologyMediaCommunications/2014_uk_tmt_value_of_connectivity_deloitte_ireland.pdf&quot;&gt;catalyze civic engagement&lt;/a&gt;. Reading these reports, it seems we’re in an all-hands-on-deck moment to get bandwidth into every last corner of the earth. But what about the risks?&lt;/p&gt;
