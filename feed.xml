        <title>This Week</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear friends and colleagues: we had a lighthearted blog post ready to go this week, but in light of recent events, we’re sure it can wait. Instead, we’re using this time to pause and reflect about the killing of George Floyd and the years of structural racism and inequities that his story represents, both in the U.S. and across the countries where DAI works. We’re also thinking about cities and communities reeling from a combination of a global pandemic and widespread unrest. In the meantime, take care and stay strong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Collaboration: Recommendations from a Six-Week Veteran</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, I have been reading article after article about how to run a successful virtual workshop, training, event, and so on, all of which provided useful advice. But, as I have run my fair share of virtual meetings these days, and because I am often described as “direct” by my peers and colleagues, I thought I would take a stab at making my own list of to-the-point recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Castles Made of Sand: Digital Transformation From the Silicon Up</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Silicon chips are literally black boxes to most of us. We understand that transistors are somehow etched in tiny patterns on these silicon wafers, and that these patterns make possible the computers, phones, and other electronic devices that run our modern world. Digital solutions are built on a foundation of silicon, and the landscape of silicon chip production is changing in ways that could have far-reaching impact on how that foundation is laid, and by whom.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Innovator Interview: Talking Financial Inclusion with MIX</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We recently spoke with Nikhil Gehani, Director of Communications at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themix.org/&quot;&gt;MIX&lt;/a&gt;, a global data resource for socially responsible investors and businesses, about inclusive finance and what it means for low-income countries. This is an excerpt of that interview.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Privacy: How COVID-19 Has Sped Up the Debate</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As many countries struggle to manage the COVID-19 crisis, governments globally are looking to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-30/the-world-embraces-contact-tracing-technology-to-fight-covid-19?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;data-driven technologies&lt;/a&gt; to minimize cases or to help facilitate a transition out of lockdown. The technologies being claimed to protect, prevent, and track include &lt;a href=&quot;corona.asan.gov.af&quot;&gt;symptom tracking apps&lt;/a&gt; that help us understand the disease, digital contact tracing apps that alert us to our interaction with the virus, quarantine enforcement apps that monitor people’s compliance (such as those in Hong Kong, Poland, and Kazakhstan; proposed in Russia and Egypt), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ukauthority.com/articles/open-university-develops-digital-certificate-for-covid-19-immunity/&quot;&gt;immunity certification&lt;/a&gt; that identify individuals who have had COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more developed nations such as the United Kingdom and United States, conversations around data privacy are rife. For example, the UK National Health Service (NHS) is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52441428&quot;&gt;negotiating&lt;/a&gt; with Google and Apple about the efficacy of its proposed contact-tracing app in light of the two tech giants’ stringent adherence to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of serious threats, many of us might say we have a reasonable expectation that our government will use technology to track and pre-empt risks. In the same way we might expect protection from terrorist attacks, we may also accept such measures to be employed during a public health crisis like the current pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the vital question is: how can we ensure that the deployment of these digital tools are effective and do not set a dangerous precedent of digital surveillance?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>COVID-19 Data Analysis, Part 5: Different Models of Infection Rates in Mexico and What they Tell Us</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The challenges of measuring the infection rates of COVID-19 are enormous for even the most prepared countries, given the need for testing to reach a significant enough amount of the population to accurately detect its spread. While the total number of recorded cases in the world thus far have mostly been in the United States, Europe, and East Asia, many low- and middle-income countries have begun to see increases in reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Mexico, the number of cases has slowly risen. Public health experts have &lt;a href=&quot;https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/coronavirus/experts-say-mexico-hasnt-done-enough-virus-testing/&quot;&gt;urgently suggested&lt;/a&gt; that testing needs to be dramatically increased to appropriately track the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the graph below shows, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries&quot;&gt;numbers reported from Worldometer&lt;/a&gt; corroborate this testing deficit, as Mexico has one of the lowest rates of testing per 1 million people in the region, even among countries of similar size and income per capita.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Ways Entrepreneurship Ecosystems are Using Technology to Adapt to the COVID-19 Crisis</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During this unprecedented global economic downturn caused by COVID-19, accelerators, incubators, and other entrepreneurship support organizations have a valuable role to play in helping entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in emerging and frontier markets. Over the past two months supporting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-shell-livewire-global-consultancy&quot;&gt;Shell LiveWIRE&lt;/a&gt; global entrepreneurship program and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/ghana-kosmos-innovation-center-kic&quot;&gt;Kosmos Innovation Center&lt;/a&gt;, DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/sustainable-business&quot;&gt;Sustainable Business Group&lt;/a&gt; has worked closely with the Global Accelerator Network (&lt;a href=&quot;C:\\Users\\ZRaheem\\Documents\\DAI\\Sustainable Business Group (SBG)\\Brown Bag Presentations\\10 Trends Changing Entrepreneurship Ecosystems\\Blog on Entrepreneurship Trends\\gan.co&quot;&gt;GAN&lt;/a&gt;) and the Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs (&lt;a href=&quot;http://andeglobal.org/&quot;&gt;ANDE&lt;/a&gt;) to leverage technology in support of global entrepreneurship in emerging economies. For corporates, foundations, donors, and development banks that support similar entrepreneurship ecosystems, we offer some learning here from our projects and global networks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Information Liberation: What is Open Data, and Why Does it Matter?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Less than two weeks ago, on April 21, 2020, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/04/21/open-data-campaign-divide/&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; announced its support for the growing open data movement through the launch of an “Open Data Campaign.” Having recently spent several days researching successful open data initiatives, the statement caught my attention. The World Bank uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://opendatatoolkit.worldbank.org/en/essentials.html&quot;&gt;the Open Knowledge Foundation’s definition&lt;/a&gt; for open data. According to it, open data means data “can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose.” In practical terms, this means data that is both &lt;em&gt;legally&lt;/em&gt; open, publicly accessible or with minimal restrictions, and &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; open, published in electronic formats that are computer readable and nonproprietary. This type of data is not to be confused with “big data.” As I recently learned, there are differences. For instance, open data derives its value from the sharing of the data and its widespread availability, rather than the volume (as big data does). I won’t be spending more time on this particular topic, but if you’re interested in learning more, I highly recommend reading a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/should-big-data-be-open-data.html&quot;&gt;guest post&lt;/a&gt; we published on the subject in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Everything Old is New Again: Remembering the Lessons of Early ICT4D in the COVID-19 Era</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Often in the early days of digital development, it felt like there was a small group of big, innovative brains in one room all working on similar visions of how best to leverage the growing presence of the iconic Nokia 3310 across the developing world. Frontline SMS, Ushahidi, Souktel, and other groups were leading the charge from various corners of the earth, and design luminaries such as Jan Chipchase were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/13/magazine/13anthropology-t.html&quot;&gt;interviewed&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; think pieces on how cellphones could end global poverty. When I moved to Palestine to work for Souktel at the end of 2010, I was often in the same room as ICT4D “godparents” &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Banks&quot;&gt;Ken Banks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/waugaman/&quot;&gt;Adele Waugaman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Hersman&quot;&gt;Erik Hersman&lt;/a&gt;, pleading our case to skeptical mobile network operators and Silicon Valley types who found our little ventures thrilling in a slightly Orientalist way. With texting as the tech &lt;em&gt;du jour&lt;/em&gt;, everyone codified similar lessons in real time around the successful design of, for example, mobile awareness campaigns. The ICT4D sector grew rapidly across markets, simultaneously building strong use cases for users and development practitioners alike. I do have some hilarious stories of mobile campaign lessons learned from the Somali piracy crisis, but I will save those for another post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, all these lessons are relevant again as we globally try to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
