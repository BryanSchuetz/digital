        <title>Unlocking the Potential of Generative AI in Cybersecurity: A Roadmap to Opportunities and Challenges</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the first in a series of blog posts about cybersecurity to mark Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a fascinating field that is taking the world by storm. It is a cutting-edge technology that allows algorithms to create new and unique data, which was unimaginable just a few years ago. While traditional AI models are designed to recognize and classify existing patterns, generative AI models are trained to generate new patterns and unique output data. With generative AI, the possibilities are endless—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F&quot;&gt;MidJourney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/dall-e-2&quot;&gt;DALL-E&lt;/a&gt; create art, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/auth/login&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; writes compelling pieces of text that are nearly indistinguishable from those created by humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine the potential of this technology in industries such as healthcare and cybersecurity, where it can be used to create new and innovative solutions to existing problems. The possibilities are truly endless, and we are only at the beginning of this exciting journey. However, despite offering exciting opportunities and applications in cybersecurity, generative AI comes with its challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Government-Run Digital Tools to Combat Corruption: Can They Work?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Originally &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-developments.com/articles/government-run-digital-tools-to-combat-corruption-can-they-work/&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; on DAI’s Developments blog.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014 and early 2015, more than 3,000 volunteers peered into their monitors to try and decipher poorly handwritten and scanned &lt;a href=&quot;https://star.worldbank.org/focus-area/asset-declarations?ref=pubs.ghost.io&quot;&gt;annual asset declarations&lt;/a&gt; from Ukrainian officials that described their properties, vehicles, land, commercial venues, bank accounts, and cash. It was a tedious task. At times, it seemed that civil servants deliberately used bad handwriting to comply with the requirements of paper-based transparency. By 2022, before the full-scale war, any internet user would have free access to more than 2.5 million asset declarations searchable through the public registry of the National Agency for Prevention of Corruption of Ukraine and at least one advanced civil society powered instrument that worked on the data-fuel from this registry. The difference was night and day. Now, instead of peering into illegible scans of handwritten scribbles, with a click of a button you can check whether a company owned by civil servant John Doe won any government contracts last year, and whether his elderly parents bought a mansion close to the capital or a new luxury car—and ask questions to the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments worldwide are rushing to use digital technology to reduce corruption. Over the past decade, state agencies have increasingly used digital systems to conduct anti-corruption investigations, gather and analyze asset declarations, automate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/uploads/E-Procurement%20pages.pdf?ref=pubs.ghost.io&quot;&gt;electronic procurement processes&lt;/a&gt;, and analyze open data. Despite initial implementation difficulties in many countries, these digital tools have &lt;a href=&quot;https://star.worldbank.org/publications/automated-risk-analysis-asset-and-interest-declarations-public-officials?ref=pubs.ghost.io&quot;&gt;proven effective&lt;/a&gt;. Many governments that benefit from donor assistance are now asking to prioritize resources for upgrading or building new IT systems to help counter corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Do You Get When You Combine Digital Infrastructure, Skills, and Trust with Affordability and Device Access? Introducing Our Concept of Digital Readiness</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration (CDA) has done many deep dives about different topic areas on &lt;em&gt;Digital@DAI&lt;/em&gt; over the years, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/realizing-inclusive-digital-development-through-boosting-the-digital-skills-of-people-living-with-disabilities.html&quot;&gt;digital skills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/cybersecurity-frontier-insights-findings-user-perceptions-of-trust-and-privacy-on-the-internet.html&quot;&gt;digital trust&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/realizing-inclusive-connectivity-in-liberia-through-a-trusted-technical-engagement.html&quot;&gt;digital infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/covid-19.html&quot;&gt;affordability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/embracing-the-unlikely-resilience-of-feature-phones.html&quot;&gt;access&lt;/a&gt;. For the first time ever, I am going to bring them all together under the umbrella of “digital readiness.” Before we get there, however, I want to acknowledge that CDA is not the first organization to come up with its own definition for this term. How have others defined digital readiness?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>As Democracy Goes Digital, Cybersecurity Takes Precedence: 5 Critical Resources For Protecting Elections Against Digital Threats</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;From introducing biometric voter verification machines in Kenya to testing an internet voting pilot in Norway, election management bodies (EMBs) have increasingly digitized elections in efforts to increase efficiency, promote transparency, and encourage greater voter participation. While many elections have increasingly involved technology, including digital voter rolls, biometric voter registration, and electronic voting machines, these critical democratic processes have become more susceptible to a rapidly evolving threat—cyberattacks. Failure to address cybersecurity risks inherent to a digitized electoral process can pose a grave threat to electoral integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Playing the Short and Long Game: The Importance of Adaptability in Cybersecurity Programming</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: This post is adapted from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitaldevforum.com/agenda/playing-the-short-and-long-game-the-importance-of-adaptability-in-cybersecurity-programming&quot;&gt;lightning talk&lt;/a&gt; presented at the recent Global Digital Development Forum (GDDF) 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, DAI has expanded its cybersecurity portfolio to cover regions including Asia-Pacific, Eastern Europe, and the Western Balkans. Designing and delivering programs that focus on building the resilience of cybersecurity stakeholders and ecosystems involves investments in three key elements of cybersecurity: people, process, and technology. It also demands that we apply this approach with local existing conditions. Importantly, cybersecurity programming also requires flexibility for rapid responses in case of unforeseen and new threats, political turnover, or major geopolitical developments expanding cyber or hybrid warfare. This is naturally dictated by realities and conditions in the geographies where we work, where local actors and beneficiaries often face external shocks requiring adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bridging the Gender Digital Divide: Four Approaches to Bringing Women Online From the USAID/Microsoft Airband Initiative</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Globally, women are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsma.com/r/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-Mobile-Gender-Gap-Report-2022.pdf&quot;&gt;18 percent&lt;/a&gt; less likely than men to own a smartphone. This statistic illustrates—particularly in low-income, rural households—the “gender digital divide,” where women are less likely to be connected to the internet and lack access to important tools that could improve their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gender digital divide limits women and girls’ opportunities on all fronts—from gaining an education to accessing their finances online to participating in politics and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing how digital inclusion empowers women and boosts the economies of rural communities, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/usaid-microsoft-airband-initiative&quot;&gt;USAID/Microsoft Airband Initiative&lt;/a&gt; has partnered with six private companies in five countries to provide women and girls with meaningful connectivity, internet access, and the skills necessary to navigate the digital world.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Kids are Alright: Reframing “Digital Natives”  for International Development</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is adapted from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitaldevforum.com/agenda/the-kids-are-alright-reframing-digital-natives-for-international-development&quot;&gt;lightning talk&lt;/a&gt; presented at the 2023 Global Digital Development Forum (GDDF).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term digital native was coined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Prensky&quot;&gt;Mark Prensky&lt;/a&gt; in 2001. The writer and educator used it to broadly describe a generation that grew up in an era shaped by the internet and digital technology. Digital natives are believed to possess a mastery of technological skills that are inherently different from prior generations. Prensky referred to the arrival of the digital age as a “singularity” that caused students of the time to “think and process information fundamentally differently than their predecessors.” These skills were attributed to the early introduction of digital tools into the homes, schools, and social lives of young people and the perception that this technology is seamlessly integrated into their daily interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Toward More Transparent and Accountable AI Algorithms in Public Service Delivery: Insights from Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, and Rwanda</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;From our social media feeds to the societal benefits we receive, artificial intelligence (AI) is everywhere and affects everyone. AI may assist us in a variety of ways: it can execute difficult, risky, or tedious tasks on our behalf; assist us in saving lives and coping with natural disasters; entertain us; and make our daily lives more enjoyable. AI helps doctors make decisions about our health and helps judges and lawyers sift through cases, speeding up the judicial process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments worldwide are increasingly turning to AI algorithms to automate or support decision-making in public services. Algorithms assist in urban planning, prioritize social-care cases, make decisions about welfare entitlements, detect unemployment fraud, or monitor people in criminal justice and law enforcement settings. The use of these algorithms is often seen to improve efficiency and lower the costs of public services.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Frontier Insights Libya: Understanding Children’s Digital Access</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sesame Workshop and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) partnered to address the critical needs of children affected by the Syrian conflict and other crises in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ahlansimsim.org/&quot;&gt;Ahlan Simsim initiative&lt;/a&gt; addresses the urgent needs of children affected by crisis and conflict by creating educational resources that reach children through an award-winning and impactful TV series viewed by more than 23 million children and through early childhood services that integrate media reaching more than 1 million children and caregivers in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. Ahlan Simsim is exploring the possibility of expanding its work to other countries, specifically Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 18 months, DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration has been working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sesameworkshop.org/what-we-do/refugee-response&quot;&gt;Sesame Workshop&lt;/a&gt; to explore the possibilities for using digital tools to provide education services to young children living in crisis-affected communities. Using DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=digital-insights&quot;&gt;Frontier Insights™&lt;/a&gt; methodology, in 2021 DAI conducted research in &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/frontier-insights-yemen-understanding-childrens-digital-access.html&quot;&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/frontier-insights-colombia-understanding-childrens-digital-access.html&quot;&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/frontier-insights-south-sudan-understanding-childrens-digital-access.html&quot;&gt;South Sudan  &lt;/a&gt;to understand communities’ barriers to connectivity, technology usage habits, and ways to leverage those habits to improve access to educational content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October and November 2022, the team continued its research in Libya, focusing on three locations: Khoms (east of Tripoli), Brak al Shati (south), and Tripoli Center. The local research team conducted surveys with 64 households, focused on children ages 3–8 and their parents or caregivers. In this blog we share the findings from that research.&lt;/p&gt;
