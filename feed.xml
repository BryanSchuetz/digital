        <title>Blockchain: Are We Beyond the Peak of The Hype Cycle?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A combination of mainstream media attention and Elon Musk’s Twitter feed has reignited the public interest in distributed ledger technologies, commonly referred to as the blockchain. CDA is no stranger to this technology; check out our blog post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/blockchain-for-development-part-1-understanding-the-tech.html&quot;&gt;blockchain&lt;/a&gt; and how we’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/getting-past-the-blockchain-hype-cycle.html&quot;&gt;applied these concepts in-house&lt;/a&gt;. Blockchain-based applications leverage technology’s ability to decrease transaction costs, maintain immutable records, and provide users with privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, international donors and the private sector have used blockchain across financial inclusion, digital government, and supply chain management. Recently, we revisited blockchain’s role in these various technical areas to assess its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle&quot;&gt;hype cycle&lt;/a&gt; and long-term deployment sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Can Regulators Keep up with Artificial Intelligence?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) presents one of the most difficult challenges to traditional regulation. Three decades ago, software was programmed; today, it’s trained. AI itself is not one technology or singular development. It is a bundle of technologies whose decision-making mode is often not fully understand by even AI developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI solutions can help address critical global challenges and deliver significant benefits; however, the technology could lead to unforeseeable outcomes absent clear regulations and ethical guidelines. AI can have damaging repercussions for data privacy, information, and cybersecurity, providing hackers with ways to access sensitive personal data, hijack systems, or manipulate devices connected to the Internet. Self-learning algorithms already anticipate human needs and wants, govern our newsfeeds, and drive our cars. How can we ensure that this technology benefits people widely? If AI and autonomous machines play a crucial role in our everyday lives, what sort of normative and ethical frameworks should guide their design?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Emerging Technologies Provide New Opportunities to Bridge the Digital Divide</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;New investments in emerging technologies offer transformational opportunities in developing countries—particularly for rural and remote populations benefiting from internet connectivity. This blog highlights three developments for potential donor interventions to work with the private sector, governments, and users to bridge the digital divide. These efforts may be complementary to planned or completed infrastructure, specifically for last-mile connectivity solutions to expand inclusive and affordable access for people across various regions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Asia Accelerator Cultivates Digital Skills for Cambodia’s Creative Sector</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Widespread digitalization has revolutionized almost every industry, including music and sound production. While rarely the focus of digital development initiatives, creative entrepreneurs such as artists and musicians in emerging economies have also found themselves scrambling to adapt to the ever-changing technology and social media landscapes. As such, this year, with funding from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Digital_Asia_Accelerator_Fact_Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Digital Asia Accelerator&lt;/a&gt; (DAA) initiative and as a part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/digital-connectivity-cybersecurity-partnership&quot;&gt;Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thesoundinitiative.com/&quot;&gt;The Sound Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (TSI)—a vocational program for musicians—launched the “Music 4.0” program to support Cambodian entrepreneurs striving to excel in this dynamic industry.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Report Offers Guidance to Support Agriculture Market Systems Actors During COVID-19</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Digital tools and services such as short message services (SMS), digitally enabled extension services, and artificial intelligence have helped market system actors in developing countries overcome common challenges in the agriculture sector, such as accessing weather information and diagnosing pest or disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the &lt;a href=&quot;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/35216/9781464816574.pdf?sequence=2&amp;amp;isAllowed=y&quot;&gt;documented value&lt;/a&gt; of these innovations, uptake of digital agriculture technology still is not widespread. A lack of affordable and accessible technologies, poor connectivity, high costs of data, and social stigmas around digital technology can be major barriers to potential users. With COVID-19 making digital connectivity critical to economic activities, development stakeholders have spent the past year and a half assessing the relationship between the pandemic and the adoption and use of digital agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Five Tools to Foster Creative Innovation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When we peel back the planning, strategy design, project management, and technical implementation layers of any creation, we see something more intuitive. More human. And that’s the desire to “create.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terms such as “innovation,” “research and development,” and “discovery” capture the adventure of the creative process. But garnering that same intensity in a workplace, let alone one’s personal life is not always the most accessible trail. In this post, I dive into some tools we employ as a team to foster creative innovation while also making reflections from another part of my life as a musician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a musician, I’ve gone through many periods of creative productivity. “Writer’s block,” as some may relate to, is the most frustrating. A quick online search generates tons of books on how to overcome creative dry spells. Meditation, exercise, and just taking a good ol’ break are some of the well-known remedies. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned from songwriting and performing, it’s that the creative process requires gentle nurturing. And just like music production, technology product development is no stranger to creative dry spells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what are some of the tools we employ as a team to foster creative technology product development?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Digital Climate Risk Assessment Tools Help Unclog Climate Finance Flows in Emerging Economies</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional lending channels are blocking access to climate finance. The large commercial banks that receive funds from investment banks accredited by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenclimate.fund/&quot;&gt;Green Climate Fund&lt;/a&gt; typically seek smaller financial institutions in local markets to distribute these funds. However, these smaller institutions often lack the tools needed to appraise risk and begin lending, meaning that funds that have been allocated towards climate mitigation, resilience building, and adaptation efforts are not being efficiently disseminated.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reflecting on the Role of Digital Solutions in Tackling USAID’s Global Priorities</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As most people in the international development community know, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/organization/samantha-power&quot;&gt;Samantha Power&lt;/a&gt;, former U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations under President Barack Obama, was nominated and officially sworn in as the 19th Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) on May 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During her confirmation hearing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/032321_Power_Testimony.pdf&quot;&gt;testimony&lt;/a&gt;, she acknowledged the longstanding priorities of USAID that would remain at the fore, such as women’s empowerment, food security, education, and global health, but also cited four particularly pressing and consequential global issues on which USAID would focus in the years ahead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Climate change&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conflict and state collapse&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Democratic backsliding&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about these priorities and what they mean for development work in the coming years, I thought about how digital solutions fit into this picture. Though not called out specifically in her testimony, digital technologies will serve a critical role in ensuring the success and effectiveness of these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What We Learned From a Deep Dive into the World of Prizes and Challenges</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, our colleagues at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USAID_Digital_Asia_Accelerator_Fact_Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;Digital Asia Accelerator&lt;/a&gt; buy-in under the Digital Frontiers project asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/authors/alexander-sekhniashvili/&quot;&gt;Alex Sekhniashvili&lt;/a&gt; and I to identify and synthesize lessons learned administering prizes and challenges across the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) portfolio. Given DAI’s long history implementing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-grand-challenges-development-implementation-services&quot;&gt;Grand Challenges for Development Implementation Services&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-center-development-innovation-professional-management-services&quot;&gt;Center for Development Innovation (CDI) Professional Management Services,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df&quot;&gt;Digital Frontiers&lt;/a&gt; projects on behalf of USAID—there are quite a lot of lessons! So Alex and I dove deep into the world of prizes and challenges, reading project documents and interviewing a number of DAI staff. Read below some of our findings.&lt;/p&gt;
