        <title>Digital Development in the Western Balkans: Bosnia and Herzegovina</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, DAI has been working closely with the United Kingdom’s Foreign Commonwealth Office (FCO) to map digital ecosystems across the Western Balkans, and to identify areas where the FCO can support the technology sector in closing the digital skill supply-demand gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through our research, we found a region that is well-placed to increase its share of the dividends of global digital expansion and interconnectedness. The Western Balkans boasts promising digital ecosystems, which are well on their way to creating significant economic growth opportunities, but that in many cases need investment and support to do so. With each country having its own specific trajectory and different operating environment, we have created a series of blogs, each outlining key findings from the six countries in the region: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, and North Macedonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up, beautiful Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Looking Ahead: What We’re Thinking About in 2020</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In our last post from 2019, we reviewed our top posts from the past year. The most-read articles covered a myriad of digital development topics—bridging the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/lessons-learned-from-cambodia.html&quot;&gt;digital gender divide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/visualizing-remotely-sensed-data-true-color-and-false-color.html&quot;&gt;visualizing remote sense data&lt;/a&gt;, and insights into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/citizen-centered-design-and-frontier-insights-in-kabul-municipality.html&quot;&gt;digital lives of Kabul’s residents&lt;/a&gt; to design an open source transparency and citizen participation app. Over the last few years, we’ve seen a sea change in how digital tools and services impact people’s lives globally. Expect 2020 to be no different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we get ready for the new decade, here are some topics we’re thinking about when it comes to digital development.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital@DAI Year in Review: Top 10 Posts of 2019</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This year, Digital@DAI published more than 60 posts covering everything from trends in entrepreneurship ecosystems to the importance of user education for digital development programming and building on user insights to develop an open-source transparency and citizen participation application for the municipality of Kabul, Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We featured digital experts from organizations such as Massachusetts Institute for Technology (MIT)’s D-Lab and information sciences and technology experts from across DAI and from our partner organizations. In addition, we featured program work we do with clients including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df&quot;&gt;Digital Frontiers&lt;/a&gt; program. Key topics of interest this year included artificial intelligence, agriculture, citizen engagement, decision support, cyber and trust, and ICT policy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Five Resources on Human Rights and Tech</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This week marked the 71st anniversary of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/&quot;&gt;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; (UNDHR)—a founding document which set out, for the first time, fundamental human rights to be universally protected. Working in international development, most of us are committed to the 30 rights laid out in the UNDHR. As the digital revolution evolves, countries have adopted a myriad of legal frameworks to protect citizens in the digital space. These laws include those focused on privacy and data protection. However, often, these policies are not aligned with the most recent technological advancements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the humanitarian and development sectors, we are digitising faster than the &lt;a href=&quot;https://reliefweb.int/report/world/future-financial-assistance-outlook-2030-enaresfr&quot;&gt;legal and ethical frameworks&lt;/a&gt; governing this digitisation. Some fear that the technology sector remains virtually a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25156&quot;&gt;human rights-free zone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Studying River Health through Citizen Science and Data Analysis in Maryland</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since 1970, DAI has worked in 160 countries on development issues ranging from good governance to environmental problems. But what about scientific policy-oriented initiatives in our backyard? With a headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland, DAI is surrounded by a vibrant and diverse social and ecological community, and civil society organizations that focus on sustainable development. At the Center for Digital Acceleration (CDA), we’ve had the good fortune of engaging two such organizations— &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spacreek.net/&quot;&gt;Spa Creek Conservancy&lt;/a&gt; (SCC) and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aacc.edu/about/schools-of-study/science-and-technology/environmental-center/&quot;&gt;Environmental Center&lt;/a&gt; at Anne Arundel Community College (AACC)—that combine formal academic research with citizen science and use data to bring awareness to the health of the Chesapeake Bay watershed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unearthing Lessons by Revisiting—Not Reinventing—the Wheel by Utilizing Data Science</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As we enter what the World Economic Forum refers to as the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/focus/fourth-industrial-revolution&quot;&gt;fourth industrial revolution&lt;/a&gt;”—a profound transformation of industries and institutions driven by artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and augmented reality—international development practitioners are shifting toward data-centric business practices that require new systems, more efficient work flows, and modern skill sets. While the promise of newly available data is driving a desire to answer new analytical questions, lessons from more than 50 years of development projects lay dormant in Word and PDF documents stored in disparate folders, databases, and online portals by a wide array of stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Apply Now: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in International Development</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies, although still relatively new concepts, are garnering a vast amount of interest in international development across sectors and geographies. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Center for Digital Development (CDD)’s Strategy &amp;amp; Research (S&amp;amp;R) team published a report in 2018, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/machine-learning/AI-ML-in-development&quot;&gt;“Reflecting the Past, Shaping the Future: Making AI work for International Development”&lt;/a&gt;, based on extensive research on this rapidly growing field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USAID would like to translate the report’s recommendations into an actionable format so the lessons and good practices are accessible to USAID program staff and implementing partners that may have limited familiarity with, nor time, to devote to the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lessons Learned from Development Innovations Team: Adapt, Serve Users, and Tell Your Story</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As an avid and committed reader of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/&quot;&gt;Digital@DAI&lt;/a&gt;, you have no doubt come across our extensive coverage of the Cambodia &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.development-innovations.org/&quot;&gt;Development Innovations&lt;/a&gt; (DI) project, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). My colleagues have chronicled efforts to address flooding by &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/civil-society-the-hard-ware-way-maker-lab-experiences-in-cambodia.html&quot;&gt;building hardware&lt;/a&gt; with locally available parts, the project’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/cambodia-civil-society-facebook.html&quot;&gt;design research with civil society groups&lt;/a&gt; in Phnom Penh, and everything in between. With a mandate to strengthen Cambodia’s civic tech ecosystem and facilitate connections between civil society and the local tech community, DI was one of the only USAID projects that focused on technology and innovation ecosystems. But alas, all good things must come to an end—especially when the mission has been achieved and staff have worked themselves out of a job.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Part I: Big Data in Agriculture Conference Download: Building Trust and Fueling Innovation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a data enthusiast with a budding curiosity in digital agriculture, I was excited to attend the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigdata.cgiar.org/hyderabad-2019/&quot;&gt;2019 CGIAR Big Data in Agriculture Convention&lt;/a&gt; in Hyderabad, India. The event brought together attendees from around the globe to connect over the theme of &lt;em&gt;Trust: humans, machines, and ecosystems.&lt;/em&gt; The CGIAR Big Data Platform aims to “use big data approaches to solve agriculture development problems faster, better, and at greater scale than before.” The platform does this by connecting CGIAR-affiliated researchers from around the globe with development practitioners and ag-tech providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only did I have the rare opportunity to engage with super smart scientist-types who, unlike me, have job titles like “plant geneticist” and “mycology and plant pathology specialist,” but I also was compelled to consider the definition and role of trust in the application of data and technology to building resilient global food security.&lt;/p&gt;
