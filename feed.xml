        <title>Beyond Features: Designing for the World’s ‘Digital Explorers’</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent post, former U.K. parliamentarian and current Vice President for Global Affairs and Communications at Facebook, Nick Clegg wrote an extensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://nickclegg.medium.com/you-and-the-algorithm-it-takes-two-to-tango-7722b19aa1c2&quot;&gt;defense&lt;/a&gt; of the company’s role in political polarization and the spread of hate speech, among other contemporary issues. Clegg’s argument is summed up in the title of the piece: “You and the Algorithm: It Takes Two to Tango.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What is Agile? Part One: The Story Behind the Buzzword</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Agile methodology has been a trending topic for a while now and it typically describes a wide range of approaches to software development, project management, and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/bruce_feiler_agile_programming_for_your_family?language=en&quot;&gt;raising children&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone loves to say they work on an agile team or to describe their company as an agile organization. While it’s true that its widespread use has changed the way people work, the details around agile have started to become diluted to the point where no one really knows what it means anymore. The Agile Alliance, an organization that supports those who use Agile, defines it broadly as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/&quot;&gt;the ability to create and respond to change.”&lt;/a&gt; This post is the first in a series aimed at unpacking this buzzword and how the set of ideas it represents can be used effectively in international development contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Five Fresh Tips to Make Digital Safety Cool Again: A Case Study from Thailand</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asia is one of the world’s fastest-growing regions for digital connectivity. Thai people, for example, spend on average nine hours a day using the internet on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationthailand.com/news/30382735&quot;&gt;mobile phones.&lt;/a&gt; That’s the second highest in the world! And 95 percent of all Thais connected to the internet use Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/uploads/Thaniya%201.png&quot; alt=&quot;Thaniya 1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have all heard about the dangers that come with using social media—misinformation, privacy concerns, and cyber bullying—just to name a few. But people in Thailand, like many places around the world, are still very invested in social media platforms, despite the challenges. So how might we turn this challenge into an opportunity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and DAI are collaborating with Facebook Thailand, Love Frankie, a local social change agency, and 400 university students around the country in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/asia-regional/press-releases/feb-9-2021-united-states-promotes-digital-literacy-thailand&quot;&gt;Wai Kid Digital Challenge&lt;/a&gt; to demystify digital safety and citizenship and educate the public about positive online communication, identity and security, news literacy, and critical thinking through creative videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are five fresh tips we have learned from the Challenge so far to make sure your next digital safety activity delivers results.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Going Virtual with Learning</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For some professions, the past year has normalized virtual interactions and digital collaboration. While many jobs and activities still require in-person interaction, others have moved online as much as possible. Conferences are virtual. Weekly meetings take place through a screen. And classrooms have gone online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people who have engaged with learning this past year have had some kind of digital experience. This is true across all ages—and, we have seen, often with mixed success. Nevertheless, at our Center for Digital Acceleration, we know that, as the saying goes—“the show must go on”—and we have done our best to help DAI’s projects around the globe make their in-person courses and activities come alive in our virtual world. In this post, we offer some brief reflections on the different types of online training our projects are developing, and then ask the question: is this the new normal?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>In Honor of Women’s History Month: Exploring the Gender Digital Divide</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With March being Women’s History Month, it feels appropriate to reflect on progress made towards the United Nations’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/&quot;&gt;Sustainable Development Goal No. 5&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls&lt;/em&gt;. Over the years, development programs have made significant strides in recognizing and alleviating the inequality that exists between men and women worldwide, though there is still much to be done. From DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration’s perspective, it is particularly important to highlight the disparities that exist in the realm of digital tools and opportunities. In today’s world, where access to the internet and digital applications is increasingly valuable for both personal and professional purposes, female empowerment efforts must include the prioritization of women’s digital access, literacy, and inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Are We Reading about Digital Transformation and COVID-19?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I find it difficult to use the word in this context, but there may be one &lt;strong&gt;positive&lt;/strong&gt;—if not collateral—effect of COVID-19: after the decades of support the digital development community has provided to businesses and consumers around the world to help, the adoption of digital technologies has accelerated in mere months. There’s a new willingness to embrace the digital economy, as restrictions against in-person interactions move people online and require the use of digital tools out of necessity. This process, often called digital transformation, has been discussed by a variety of sources, outlining both its benefits and risks. We thought it might be helpful to provide an overview of some of the articles, blogs, and resources we are reading to leverage this momentum. This list is by no means exhaustive, but rather provides a few highlights to get you started. I’ve broken down the readings into three, highly academic categories: 1. This is really happening, 2. and the benefits could be huge, 3. but please do not forget the risks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Electronic Waste is Relevant for the Digital Development Community</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently cleaning my house when I came across three old mobile phones: a feature phone, a BlackBerry, and an iPhone. I found myself wondering, “&lt;em&gt;Why did I keep these?&lt;/em&gt;” Immediately, I thought, “&lt;em&gt;the pictures&lt;/em&gt;,” but then quickly remembered that nowadays when everything can be saved to the cloud, that justification makes no sense. When I finished organizing, I found that I had left the three phones on my desk, as if they were patiently waiting for me to do something with them. It quickly dawned on me that I actually did not know what to do with them… not from a sentimental perspective, but rather from a lack of knowledge of how to securely dispose of technology. Shouldn’t many of the pieces and parts be reusable to build new devices or maintain old ones? Is there an equivalent to an electronics recycling bin?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Innovator Series: Talking About Online Campaigns for Change with Sotheavy AT</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We recently spoke with Sotheavy AT, the Founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/pg/ThinkPlasticNow/community/&quot;&gt;Think Plastic&lt;/a&gt;, a hugely popular digital environmental advocacy campaign working to reduce plastic waste and inspire action from citizens across Cambodia. (She’s also the former Senior Innovation Program Manager for the DAI-led &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/cambodia-development-innovations&quot;&gt;Development Innovations&lt;/a&gt;, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and a consultant on DAI projects across Southeast Asia.) Think Plastic started small, with two- to three-minute videos in 2019, and has grown rapidly to reach more than 4 million Cambodians in just one year—almost 25 percent of the population of the country. As more businesses, organizations, and citizens go online around the world in the COVID-19 era, we have seen evidence of how well-designed and well-executed online campaigns can rapidly advance development outcomes. Think Plastic has been widely recognized for its success by the Royal Government of Cambodia’s Ministry of Environment and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khmertimeskh.com/50814112/at-sotheavy-award-winning-anti-plastic-pioneer/&quot;&gt;Women of the Future Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt; and is now a well-known brand across the country. This is an excerpt from that interview.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Development for Newbies, Part 2: Sophomore Edition</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This month I’ve been reflecting on all that has happened since this time last year, back when we were still blissfully unaware of the trials, trauma, and transformation 2020 would bring. Instead of focusing on the challenges we faced over the last several months, I’d like to highlight some relevant concepts for colleagues who are gaining momentum in understanding and incorporating digital technologies into their international development work. Below are some important topics (upon which my tech-savvy colleagues and others have written extensively, so check out the links!) that can be applied across our development projects and fieldwork. Consider this the sophomore edition of the “Digital Development for Newbies” series, but if you’re brand new to this topic, I encourage you to start with &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/digital-development-for-newbies-part-1-the-basics.html&quot;&gt;Part 1: The Basics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
