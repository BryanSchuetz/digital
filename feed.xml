        <title>Digital Downsides: The Economic Impact of Misinformation and Other Digital Harms on MSMEs in Kenya, India, and Cambodia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Digitalization presents both opportunities and challenges for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in emerging markets. Digital tools can increase business efficiency and reach, but also increase exposure to misinformation, fraud, and cyber attacks. Such “digital downsides” can lead to financial losses, reputational damage, loss of customer trust, and other challenges that hinder MSMEs’ ability—and desire—to participate in the digital economy. In this post, we’re previewing a soon-to-be-released report that DAI authored about the economic impact of misinformation and other digital harms on MSMEs in Kenya, India, and Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of our research, and with the help of our in-country local partners, we asked 85 business owners about their understanding and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/building-resilience-against-disinformation.html&quot;&gt;awareness of misinformation&lt;/a&gt; and other digital downsides and the impact of these experiences on their businesses. We further wanted to understand the types of digital tools (social media platforms, messaging services, digital payment devices, etc.) that business owners in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs) use and what gaps exist that could be filled through training or by government, private sector, nonprofit and other actors. Lastly, we uncovered how misinformation factors into a business context, rather than an electoral or public health context (which is how misinformation has typically been studied).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Call to Action: Igniting the Digital Revolution in International Development Studies</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/call-action-igniting-digital-revolution-international-development-studies&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; originally appeared on the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technological advancements are transforming every sector of the global economy, opening the way for governments, businesses, and individuals to drastically reframe how they engage with one another. The field of international development is not immune to these changes and has, in fact, seen a marked shift in new approaches and business models in response to today’s digital age. Development practitioners are actively responding to the increased role of tools like artificial intelligence, digital identity, digital financial services, and geospatial visualization in project design and implementation. However, the increased use of digital technology also carries real risks to users. Beyond cybersecurity and data privacy breaches, the rise in disinformation and misinformation, the increased risk of misuse, bias, and discrimination, and the growing trend of digital authoritarianism around the world are all causes for concern.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital@DAI Year in Review: Top 10 Posts of 2022</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As we do annually, it is time for the Top 10 Posts of 2022. What a year! A bit of a return to normalcy after the hardships of 2021, with a welcome return to childcare (not joking), in-person meetings, and travel to connect with colleagues and do technical work globally. In the digital development world, a continued reckoning with the complex challenges of advanced technologies and the multitude of benefits—and risks—of widespread digital transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happily, it seems our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/looking-ahead-what-were-thinking-about-in-2022.html&quot;&gt;predictions&lt;/a&gt; for what we’re thinking about in 2022 were largely correct. Through Digital@DAI, we covered topics as varied as &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/cda-insights-2022-toward-ethical-artificial-intelligence-in-international-development.html&quot;&gt;ethical artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (AI) and its importance in international development, a robust &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/digital-literacy-series-closing-the-gap-for-semi-literate-and-illiterate-populations.html&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; on digital literacy, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/realizing-inclusive-digital-development-through-boosting-the-digital-skills-of-people-living-with-disabilities.html&quot;&gt;disability divide&lt;/a&gt; in ICT. Interestingly, the top two most-read posts published in 2022 were &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=climate&quot;&gt;climate tech-focused&lt;/a&gt;. Climate tech has been called the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/how-we-help-clients/cop/the-cop26-daily/climate-technology-a-new-frontier-for-innovation-and-growth&quot;&gt;new frontier for innovation and growth&lt;/a&gt;” and investments in the sector are at an all-time high. Our readers’ engagement with these posts aligns with the expanding focus on this area in digital development.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chatbots for the International Development and Humanitarian Sectors: What Works?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed chatbots becoming more commonplace in your life. Buying yourself a new sound system online? A chatbot pops up offering help. Need to confirm flight details? The airline’s chatbot can do that for you. Chatbots can offer a quick and easy way to get the information you need on the platform you are already using, whether that be a website, Facebook Messenger, or WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they operate with low bandwidth and are simple to use, chatbots seem like they could be a beneficial technology to engage with recipients of our development and humanitarian programs, don’t they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any technology, the use of chatbots is migrating from the private sector and becoming more prevalent in crisis and conflict response. However, documentation of lessons learned, successes and failures, and best practices of the use of chatbots in the development and humanitarian sectors are still few and far between. Through our work with Sesame Workshop, DAI conducted desk research and key informant interviews to examine use cases and review lessons learned for the use of chatbots in the international development and humanitarian sectors. In this blog, we summarize our key findings.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Look Into the Future: Rwanda’s Road to Digital Transformation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, my family was visiting me in Rwanda. We were traveling two hours outside of the capital, in a rural, forested area, on what seemed to be the only straight patch of road in the mountainous country. As we were admiring the landscape, in my rearview mirror, I saw a flash. I knew she got me. Sophia—one of Rwanda’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ktpress.rw/2021/11/rwanda-police-drivers-in-traffic-fines-controversy/&quot;&gt;notorious traffic cameras&lt;/a&gt; (jokingly called “Sophia” by Rwandans and named after a humanoid robot that spoke at the Transform Africa Summit in 2019) cruelly captured me going over the speed limit. Within 15 minutes, I received a speeding ticket via text message. I quickly paid the fine through Rwanda’s mobile money app, MoMo, and we continued our trip. Despite the ticket, I had to marvel at the technology that underpinned the entire exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital@DAI Rewind: The Rise of TikTok—How One App is Making Waves in the Global Development Community</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recently, I’ve been thinking about how the organizational shifts at Twitter will affect TikTok. With Tesla CEO Elon Musk now owning one of the world’s most high-profile information systems, there are bound to be changes in user satisfaction. While TikTok and Twitter have different features and purposes, a few questions have popped up for me. Will we see more users flocking to TikTok due to Musk’s acquisition (or vice versa)? Will TikTok’s brand, ownership, or features change to compete with Twitter’s upcoming changes? Will communities find new ways to organize and communicate beyond both apps? Is it a matter of time before a more unique, more innovative platform rides the wave (and hopefully, betters all of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://oakparktalon.org/15364/opinion/tiktok-is-shortening-our-attention-spans/&quot;&gt;attention spans&lt;/a&gt;)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While I don’t have the answers to any of these questions, I do have the answer to one question: Is TikTok really that influential?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>In Case You Missed It—Discussing the Impact and Implications of AI on Digital Inclusion at the NetHope Conference</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month, DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration hosted a panel discussion during the NetHope Global Summit featuring artificial intelligence (AI) experts representing the public, private, and civil society sectors to discuss practical uses for facial recognition technology (FRT) and its impact on digital inclusion. The panelists presented specific case studies where they have seen their work intersect with AI and facial recognition technologies and digital inclusion, providing lessons learned for attendees to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Headlining, Part 2: How Misinformation Could Impact Development Programming</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In December 2021, I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/headlining-part-1-spreading-misinformation.html&quot;&gt;Headlining, Part I: Spreading Misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, which defines “headlining” as a form of misinformation that uses a sensational headline to uncritically pass along false information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also offered tips and tricks to avoid falling victim to headlining, like taking a moment to pause and ask yourself, “Does this sound too good or too awful to be true?” and actually reading a news article before you share it. Now I want to take headlining and situate it directly in the contexts and communities in which international development practitioners work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Potential Value of AI—and How Governments Could Capture It, Part 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/the-potential-value-of-ai-and-how-governments-could-look-to-capture-it&quot;&gt;McKinsey &amp;amp; Company&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) could have a significant impact on individuals, businesses, and governments. Here is what countries need to know about its benefits—and the first steps toward realizing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long-term potential of AI to change key aspects of the way we live and to support the operations of businesses, governments, and other organizations is hard to grasp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, AI has contributed to improvements in quality of life for all segments of society through innovations such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/transforming-healthcare-with-ai&quot;&gt;predictive healthcare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/education/our-insights/how-artificial-intelligence-will-impact-k-12-teachers&quot;&gt;adaptive education&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/applying-artificial-intelligence-for-social-good&quot;&gt;optimized crisis response&lt;/a&gt;. The National Health Service in the United Kingdom, for instance, set up a National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database containing a shared library of chest X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images to support the testing and development of AI technologies to treat COVID-19 and a variety of other health conditions. Businesses have seen increased productivity and operational efficiency using autonomous robotics in manufacturing, AI-optimized supply chains, and intelligent cargo routing with autonomous vehicles, among other initiatives. For example, many logistics companies are using AI-powered sorting robots to optimize their warehouse operations. Governments can also harness the power of AI through personalized services and automated processes. Consider Singapore’s “Ask Jamie,” a virtual assistant that helps citizens and businesses navigate government services across roughly 70 government agencies through AI-powered chat and voice.&lt;/p&gt;
