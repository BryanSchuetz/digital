        <title>Information Liberation: What is Open Data, and Why Does it Matter?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Less than two weeks ago, on April 21, 2020, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/04/21/open-data-campaign-divide/&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; announced its support for the growing open data movement through the launch of an “Open Data Campaign.” Having recently spent several days researching successful open data initiatives, the statement caught my attention. The World Bank uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://opendatatoolkit.worldbank.org/en/essentials.html&quot;&gt;the Open Knowledge Foundation’s definition&lt;/a&gt; for open data. According to it, open data means data “can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose.” In practical terms, this means data that is both &lt;em&gt;legally&lt;/em&gt; open, publicly accessible or with minimal restrictions, and &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; open, published in electronic formats that are computer readable and nonproprietary. This type of data is not to be confused with “big data.” As I recently learned, there are differences. For instance, open data derives its value from the sharing of the data and its widespread availability, rather than the volume (as big data does). I won’t be spending more time on this particular topic, but if you’re interested in learning more, I highly recommend reading a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/should-big-data-be-open-data.html&quot;&gt;guest post&lt;/a&gt; we published on the subject in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Everything Old is New Again: Remembering the Lessons of Early ICT4D in the COVID-19 Era</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Often in the early days of digital development, it felt like there was a small group of big, innovative brains in one room all working on similar visions of how best to leverage the growing presence of the iconic Nokia 3310 across the developing world. Frontline SMS, Ushahidi, Souktel, and other groups were leading the charge from various corners of the earth, and design luminaries such as Jan Chipchase were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/13/magazine/13anthropology-t.html&quot;&gt;interviewed&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; think pieces on how cellphones could end global poverty. When I moved to Palestine to work for Souktel at the end of 2010, I was often in the same room as ICT4D “godparents” &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Banks&quot;&gt;Ken Banks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/waugaman/&quot;&gt;Adele Waugaman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Hersman&quot;&gt;Erik Hersman&lt;/a&gt;, pleading our case to skeptical mobile network operators and Silicon Valley types who found our little ventures thrilling in a slightly Orientalist way. With texting as the tech &lt;em&gt;du jour&lt;/em&gt;, everyone codified similar lessons in real time around the successful design of, for example, mobile awareness campaigns. The ICT4D sector grew rapidly across markets, simultaneously building strong use cases for users and development practitioners alike. I do have some hilarious stories of mobile campaign lessons learned from the Somali piracy crisis, but I will save those for another post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, all these lessons are relevant again as we globally try to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New RFA Calls for Innovative Solutions to Advance Digital Skills for Small Firms</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone is talking about digital transformation—especially now that digital processes and tools are a mandatory part of daily activities for most businesses, schools, and citizens across the world in response to the global COVID-19 outbreak. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and DAI have been working to enhance digital skills, improve connectivity, and enable locally led innovation for years. Today, we are all confronted with a new set of urgent challenges. How do we ensure that citizens can safely and effectively use digital technologies to advance their own economic livelihoods and those of their countries?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>COVID-19 Data Analysis, Part 3: Rethinking the Global Health Security Index</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The next installment in our COVID-19 analysis series connects the dots between the datasets we have explored in our previous posts and brings in a new dataset that came to our attention over the past couple of weeks. In this paper, we look at the relationship between country scores from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ghsindex.org&quot;&gt;Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI)’s Global Health Security Index&lt;/a&gt; and levels of response by country governments measured using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/oxford-covid-19-government-response-tracker%5D&quot;&gt;Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker&lt;/a&gt;. You can read more about our initial exploratory analysis of the Global Health Security Index &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/covid-19-data-analysis-part-2-health-capacity-and-preparedness.html&quot;&gt;here in our previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Oxford University has provided an initial report of its data on its website.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Approaching Digital Behavior Change Communications in the COVID-19 Era</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While tackling the spread of the COVID-19 disease takes a multi-faceted approach, behavior change—especially around personal and respiratory hygiene, proper handwashing, social distancing, and so on—remains a critical need across countries where DAI and our clients operate. Further, as organizations and individuals increasingly embrace digital-based approaches to collaboration, communication, and information gathering, we are presented with an opportunity to incorporate these technologies across behavior change communication strategies. However, as many organizations have experienced since the start of near-global lockdowns, this transition to an all-digital way of working comes with unique roadblocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks, the DAI Center for Digital Acceleration has been exploring how digital communication tools can be used to build communications campaigns aimed at stemming the COVID-19 tide and spreading accurate information about targeted behaviors. We’ve pulled together some quick thoughts on the topic, but frankly, these are principles that apply in most &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; effort of this sort.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Promoting Resilient Ecosystems: How Cambodians are Adapting in the Face of COVID-19</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Five years in Cambodia leading the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/cambodia-development-innovations&quot;&gt;Development Innovations&lt;/a&gt; project taught me a lot about innovation. I saw innovators employ entrepreneurial thinking to develop out-of-the-box, creative solutions to problems, helping hundreds of thousands of Cambodians—automated phone calls warning people of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.development-innovations.org/blog/the-tech-mermaid-alert/&quot;&gt;coming floods&lt;/a&gt; comes to mind, as does a mobile &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edemy.org/#tesdopi&quot;&gt;test prep application&lt;/a&gt; to help high school students prepare for national exams. It’s this entrepreneurial thinking that the world desperately needs in this time of hardship, where livelihoods, the economy, and social cohesion are being challenged in unprecedented ways. Which naturally begs the question: In the face of COVID-19, what happens next in Cambodia’s innovation community?&lt;/p&gt;

This analysis is Part 2 of a series on known risk factors associated with COVID-19. We aim to use publicly available data sets to identify national and subnational populations most at risk for infection and case fatality. The analysis will be updated as we receive additional data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Plan C: How Makerspaces are Providing a Stopgap for COVID-19 Supply Shortages</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the participants in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.development-innovations.org/success-stories/think-global-make-local-3d-printing-propels-young-cambodians-future/&quot;&gt;Think Global Make Local&lt;/a&gt; product development workshop, sponsored by our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/cambodia-development-innovations&quot;&gt;Cambodia Development Innovations&lt;/a&gt; project in 2016, created a design for a toy called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Doydoycompany/&quot;&gt;Doy Doy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. With &lt;em&gt;Doy Doy’s&lt;/em&gt; silicone straws and plastic connectors, kids can build complex structures. The product has gone on to achieve modest commercial success locally. I found &lt;em&gt;Doy Doy&lt;/em&gt; instructive because of the way its creator, Em Chanrithykol, ended up manufacturing the toy’s plastic connectors. Because of a lack of local injection-molding capacity and administrative barriers to importing parts made by contract manufacturers outside of Cambodia, Chanrithykol turned to a less traditional method: He contracted a local firm to churn out the parts on a battery of 3D printers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3D printing is slow, expensive, and inefficient. It is great for small runs of one-off items or prototypes, but it is a terrible way to mass manufacture a product. But the lesson of &lt;em&gt;Doy Doy&lt;/em&gt; is that a bad way to mass manufacture a product can still be better than having &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; way to mass manufacture a product. This is why I am currently manufacturing personal protective face shields for Baltimore-area hospitals in my basement.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Importance of Understanding Digital Divides During the COVID-19 Response</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Our work at DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration intersects with global COVID-19 responses in many ways. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/covid-19-data-analysis-part-1-demography-behavior-and-environment.html&quot;&gt;Earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, our data scientists presented an analysis of risk factors and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/COVID-looking-for-the-helpers-in-the-hardware-community.html&quot;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; we got a glimpse at the hardware community’s approach to the crisis. There is another element to our work that I think is critical to highlight—digital ecosystem assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
