        <title>Three Key Takeaways from USAID’s New Gender and ICT Survey Toolkit</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This past week USAID’s Global Development Lab and mStar project released the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/15396/Gender_and_ICT_Toolkit.pdf&quot;&gt;Gender and ICT Survey Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;. In an informative webinar (you can listen to the recording &lt;a href=&quot;http://solutionscenter.nethope.org/webinars/view/introducing-usaids-gender-and-ict-toolkit&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), the team that produced the report discussed both the content and the context surrounding the genesis of the toolkit. I tuned in and spent the majority of the time silently cheering, thrilled to hear USAID promoting research tactics and information needs that align with what we on DAI’s ICT team are doing with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=digital-insights&quot;&gt;Digital Insights&lt;/a&gt; work. In between cheers, I feverishly took notes and captured these three key takeaways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/USAID_Gender-and-ICT-toolkit_Cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;USAID_Gender-and-ICT-toolkit_Cover.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Qualitative &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Quantitative Data are Equally Important&lt;/strong&gt;
Long the redheaded stepchild of data in the international development world, qualitative data plays an especially important role when it comes to design work for digital initiatives—ticking a “uses Facebook” box on a survey doesn’t get at the ‘why’ and ‘how’ this usage are key elements of user-centered, high-impact design work. At DAI, we use our surveys as a conversational entry point to get at the deep, ethnographic-style qualitative data that gives us design insights: For example, that the young rural women in Jordan we were working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/for-the-love-of-facebook-consumer-insights-from-jordan.html&quot;&gt;preferred WhatsApp &lt;/a&gt;because of the privacy and ability to share siloed pieces of information with different friend and family groups. Privacy and control are significant drivers behind our outreach campaign design towards women. By both stressing the value of qualitative and quantitative data, and producing an excellent toolkit that walks the user through both, the USAID Digital Inclusion team put a significant stake in the ground to direct the ICT4D community towards a more user-centered and design-oriented approach to digital development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Local Data Collection has an Important Role in ICT4D&lt;/strong&gt;
One of the main pushbacks we get on Digital Insights is that we don’t seek out statistically significant, national-level sample populations. We don’t do this for a reason: we seek targeted, community-level insights into the specific populations we will be designing digital services for. National-level, statistically significant surveys are important and useful to paint broad pictures of trends, but we’ve &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; found, in more than 13 countries we’ve done Digital Insights research in, that the national-level data is even close to reflective of ICT access and usage rates in the populations we’re researching. If we based our design choices off of national surveys, we’d be designing the wrong stuff—and doing a real disservice to the population we’re trying to help. Technology access and usage habits move far too fast, and are far too distinct, to be accurately captured by large-scale surveys; the nimble approach of small data collection is hugely valuable when it comes to responsibly informing digital design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Pushing Beyond What to Why is Key&lt;/strong&gt;
While this point was also reflected in the first takeaway above, it really can’t be overstated: You’re not going to get the data you need without pushing beyond the survey questions to engage in deeper conversations with your informants about the why behind their technology choices. I often cite the following example to prove this point: My colleague Adam was doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/honduras-digital-insights.html&quot;&gt;Digital Insights research in rural Honduras&lt;/a&gt;. He repeatedly noted that the folks he was talking to (often, having a two-hour conversation in their kitchens) didn’t bring their cellphones out with them during the day. While this was crucial to know for digital design—it would influence timing of messages, response rates, content choices, and scheduling, etc.—he didn’t yet know the reason why they left their phones behind. When pushing the conversation to dig into this point, he was able to uncover that the Hondurans in this community didn’t feel it was safe to bring their phones out of the house—in fact, he learned that phone habits could be a fascinating data point around citizen perception of civil security. We were able to integrate this innovative data triangulation into our monitoring and evaluation plan, something that would never have happened if Adam hadn’t worked hard to get at the why.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Testing Data Collection with OpenDataKit</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Primary data collection: One of the most challenging, but necessary, components of any research project. Mobile and browser-based technologies have revolutionized the speed and efficiency of collecting data, enabling teams to work together on a centralized database without the headache of managing paper forms, or multiple excel documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this article, it’s likely you’ve used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/forms/about/&quot;&gt;Googleforms&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surveymonkey.com/&quot;&gt;Survey Monkey&lt;/a&gt; for your work. But what if you need to collect data in regions without 3G or LTE coverage? You’ll need a tool to manage offline data collection, and load the data once you access a wireless internet connection. Fortunately, there are several tools designed to do just that, and one of them is completely free and open source. It’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://opendatakit.org/&quot;&gt;OpenDataKit&lt;/a&gt; (ODK). Let’s take a look at how this technology works.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open Innovation in 60 Minutes or Less</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When we do “open innovation,” it’s essential to define the problem we are trying to solve. And crucial to that process is crafting a good “Call.”  Can this be done in 60 minutes or less?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Second Chance Fund: Learning and Iteration with Tech in Cambodia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Any honest digital designer will admit it: Most tech tools fail. At least the first time around. Getting your users to drop the old way of doing things and use your new website (or gadget, or app) isn’t easy. It doesn’t matter if it visualizes their transactions in some really clever way, or sends their user data to the cloud for real-time analysis, or even if it saves them time or money. Behavior change is difficult, and doubly so when you’re designing across cultures. Why? A few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Investments in Internet Access Must Include Investments in “Critical Digital Literacy”</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Expanding internet access in ‘last-mile markets’ is a priority for development agencies—and rightly so. The economic costs to countries that do not offer their populations internet access is high: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canback.com/files/2014_Offline_and_falling_behind_Barriers_to_Internet_adoption.pdf&quot;&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have detailed the internet’s macroeconomic boost to GDP, the economic and employment benefits of the growth in the digital sector, and the impact of ICT on small business revenue and job creation. Internet access has also been shown to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2016&quot;&gt;improve learning and health&lt;/a&gt; outcomes and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ie/Documents/TechnologyMediaCommunications/2014_uk_tmt_value_of_connectivity_deloitte_ireland.pdf&quot;&gt;catalyze civic engagement&lt;/a&gt;. Reading these reports, it seems we’re in an all-hands-on-deck moment to get bandwidth into every last corner of the earth. But what about the risks?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open Source Series Part 3: Spatial Analysis with QGIS (Article 2/2)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In my &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/open-source-series-spatial-analysis-with-qgis.html&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; I introduced QGIS, and previewed some of the basic functions in the upcoming release of Version 3.0. In this second of two articles, I’ll compare using QGIS in professional organizations to the use of proprietary software, and provide recommendations for organizations seeking to test the waters with spatial analysis. I’ve also reached out to three GIS professionals with experience integrating spatial analysis software into diplomatic and development work environments, and shared their perspectives in a Q&amp;amp;A section below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Data Management Series Part 3: Painting a Vivid Picture with Data</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome back! After reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=data-management-series&quot;&gt;previous two posts in this series&lt;/a&gt;, you’ve come a long way: you’ve devised a brilliant monitoring, evaluation, and learning plan, set up your data storage and management infrastructure, and conducted your baseline data collection. It’s finally time to get to the good stuff and dive into the data to make sense of it all—with eye-popping graphics worth of downtown billboards!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Data Management Series Part 2: Don’t Let Your Data Get Dusty</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So, after reading &lt;a href=&quot;/data-management-series-planning-and-collecting-part-1.html&quot;&gt;last week’s blog&lt;/a&gt;, you’ve developed the world’s most robust monitoring, evaluation, and learning plan. You just conducted a multi-tier baseline assessment, validating your data by triangulating data points through five different surveying tools and are excited to dig in to multivariate regression analysis. But wait! First we need to talk about data storage and management!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the international development world, an all-too-familiar sight is binders of data sitting idly on shelves in rural government offices. We all acknowledge that there are much better ways to store and maintain our results. However, many organizations only move one or two steps up the ladder: from paper and pen to .xlsx or .csv files on a laptop. While this may enable you to conduct the minimum analysis needed to satisfy your donor in an annual report, does it really maximize the value of the data we collect?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Data Management Series Part 1: Planning and Collecting</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been paying any attention to the so-called data revolution, you may have heard the expression “Data is the new oil.” The phrase has been attributed to and adopted by countless people and organizations to whom the central reasoning is clear: In the information age, data is an incredibly valuable “commodity.” The purpose of the analogy as originally made by mathematician Clive Humby in 2006 is significantly deeper though. He said that data is valuable, but cannot be used if it is unrefined. Like oil, data has to be changed, transformed, broken down, and analyzed for us to actually draw out the value locked within. This is true for anyone producing or accessing any type of raw datasets, including development organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
