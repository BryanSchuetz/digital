        <title>Management Information Systems at the Humanitarian-Social Protection Nexus, Part 1: Interoperability</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In late 2019 and early 2020, DAI and our partner &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cariboudigital.net/&quot;&gt;Caribou Digital&lt;/a&gt; worked closely with the U.K. Department for International Development (now called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-development-office&quot;&gt;U.K. Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office&lt;/a&gt;) to analyse identification and registration systems in protracted and recurrent crises. The research explored the feasibility of designing humanitarian aid management information systems (MIS) to link with social protection systems and to support a transition, in the long-term, to state social assistance. Whilst the focus was principally on the interoperability of such systems, our legal, digital, and protection brains also pushed us to focus on the risks associated with data collection, sharing, and storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is the first in a series on MIS in crises, as the findings from our research are many and broad. For those interested in reading more about the research, the external report can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/uploads/bsic-MIS-2020.pdf&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Respond Now: USAID Seeks Research Expertise in Responding to Digital Threats</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df&quot;&gt;Digital Frontiers&lt;/a&gt; project is issuing an expression of interest (EOI) to support the U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance (DRG) office’s Responding to Digital Threats Activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 21st century, digital tools increasingly are becoming irreplaceable assets for societies. While digital tools offer an unprecedented opportunity for vulnerable, underserved, and unserved populations to access information and services, they also expose people, organizations, and countries to risks—for instance, the incitement of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar through digital platforms like Facebook, the manipulation of electoral discourse through the spread of disinformation in places like Ukraine, Brazil, and Vietnam, and the reverberating effects of massive ransomware attacks felt in high, middle, and low-income countries alike. These trends pose a threat to rule-of-law, democratic process, and human rights worldwide. In particular, China is exporting to other countries an internet governance model that conflicts with U.S. values of promoting an open, interoperable, free, and secure internet and democratic norms.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Information Liberation, Part 2: Bringing the Private Sector into the Movement</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open-data sharing can offer huge benefits for development. How do we get the private sector to contribute?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my previous blog—&lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/information-liberation-what-is-open-data-and-why-does-it-matter.html&quot;&gt;Information Liberation: What is Open Data, and Why Does it Matter?&lt;/a&gt;—posted back in April, I wrote about the Open Data Movement, including its origins, advantages, and relevance to international development. The post referenced Microsoft’s announcement of its support for the movement, vowing to use the company’s resources to address the “data divide” that separates those with access to data and the ability to interpret it, from those without.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With data comes power: the power to make better, smarter decisions; to use information to your advantage; to understand trends and predict future ones. No one knows this better than the private sector—experts in collecting, organizing, and interpreting data to improve business decisions and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Innovator Series: Talking E-Commerce in Nepal with Sastodeal</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We recently spoke with Amun Thapa, founder and CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sastodeal.com/&quot;&gt;Sastodeal.com&lt;/a&gt; about Nepal’s growing e-commerce sector, the impact of COVID-19, and the company’s inclusive business model. This is an excerpt of that interview.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Success to Sustainability: Engaging Horticulturalists in Uzbekistan with Digital Tools</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When DAI staff and partners ask us for examples of how our projects have successfully used digital tools, we inevitably describe the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/uzbekistan-usaid-agricultural-value-chain-activity-uzbekistan-uzbekistan-avc&quot;&gt;Uzbekistan Agricultural Value Chains (AVC)&lt;/a&gt; activity as one of the best examples. AVC strengthens agricultural value chains by engaging horticultural producers, processors, input suppliers, and exporters. With that goal in mind, it did not take long for the project to realize they could engage people through digital tools already widely used throughout the country to reach their target audience. They were right. A key part of this approach was understanding their audience and their social media habits—in short, knowing their users. As the project now looks to build on its success in using social media as a tool for development, it is creating a sustainability model based on insights from its target audience: horticulturalists in Uzbekistan.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How the COVID-19 Pandemic is Accentuating the Digital Divide in the United States</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For those of us who work in digital development internationally, the pervasiveness of the global digital divide is constantly top of mind. The majority of our work requires us to understand the digital ecosystem in which we are operating to reach different segments of the population in a specific country. At home in the United States, COVID-19 and the push for virtual schooling and telemedicine has laid bare, for many Americans, how significant and challenging the digital divide is within the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Transforming In-Person Learning into Digital Collaboration</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 pushed people into their homes and brought to light the different options that exist to transform the way we learn from in-person settings to online classrooms. Although online learning is not new, the adoption of these learning platforms by the general population has been slow in comparison to the development of new technology-enabled education solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Are Algorithms and How Are They Biased?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the age of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech&quot;&gt;Big Tech&lt;/a&gt; and social media, the term &lt;em&gt;algorithm&lt;/em&gt; gets thrown around a lot to describe the unseen mechanism that determines what people see on social media or the suggestions that they receive on Netflix. But what exactly is an algorithm? And can an algorithm be biased?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Apply Now: Host USAID’s first-ever Digital Development Online Training</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Global Development Lab, the Center for Digital Development (CDD) addresses gaps in digital access and affordability and advances the use of technology and advanced data analysis in development. DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df&quot;&gt;Digital Frontiers&lt;/a&gt; project works closely with the CDD team to roll out and implement USAID’s Agency-wide Digital Strategy, which was released in April 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Digital Strategy, the Digital Skills Initiative is developing training sessions and resources geared towards USAID staff. These resources will support staff to increase their understanding of–and ability to use–digital tools and skills.&lt;/p&gt;
