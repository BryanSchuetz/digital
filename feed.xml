        <title>Approaching Digital Behavior Change Communications in the COVID-19 Era</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While tackling the spread of the COVID-19 disease takes a multi-faceted approach, behavior change—especially around personal and respiratory hygiene, proper handwashing, social distancing, and so on—remains a critical need across countries where DAI and our clients operate. Further, as organizations and individuals increasingly embrace digital-based approaches to collaboration, communication, and information gathering, we are presented with an opportunity to incorporate these technologies across behavior change communication strategies. However, as many organizations have experienced since the start of near-global lockdowns, this transition to an all-digital way of working comes with unique roadblocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks, the DAI Center for Digital Acceleration has been exploring how digital communication tools can be used to build communications campaigns aimed at stemming the COVID-19 tide and spreading accurate information about targeted behaviors. We’ve pulled together some quick thoughts on the topic, but frankly, these are principles that apply in most &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; effort of this sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/uploads/COVID-19_BehaviorChange.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;COVID-19_BehaviorChange.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Image from Upsplash posted by Brian McGowan.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;know-where-people-are-digitally-speaking&quot;&gt;Know Where People Are, Digitally Speaking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While mobile penetration and internet access have grown rapidly, especially in the last few years, national statistics often hide regional or demographic variations in access, usage, and digital inclusion. To target digital communications, we must first have answers—even notional ones—to some basic questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who are we trying to reach? Who are the target populations whose behaviors need changing, and can have the widest, most positive impact on infection rates and other critical metrics?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What kinds of digital tools do these groups have access to? What barriers (access to devices, mobile bandwidth, electricity) are limiting when and how they can be reached?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which digital channels—social networks, user-generated content (like YouTube), or others—do these groups use the most?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How—if at all—has COVID-19 affected digital access of users (e.g. is wifi access no longer a given in urban areas?)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understand-local-context-and-user-motivationand-design-appropriate-message&quot;&gt;Understand Local Context and User Motivation—and Design Appropriate Message&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All behavior change communications must contend with—and cut through—a crowded digital information ecosystem. Users’ attention is limited, and in an era where COVID-19 material is being broadcast by federal and local governments, private companies, local community leaders, and family networks, any new messaging needs to be based on a clear understanding of the local information landscape and users’ motivations. Messages need to be tailored to this context, using local languages, idioms, and content, ideally generated and vetted by trusted, influential local people. For example, information from the World Health Organization (WHO) may be trusted and helpful for us sitting in capital cities such as Nairobi or New York, but will not likely resonate with some of our most important constituents in rural Mexico or Cambodia, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;messenger-is-just-as-important-as-messagedont-try-to-build-trust-from-scratch&quot;&gt;Messenger is Just as Important as Message—Don’t Try to Build Trust from Scratch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the COVID-19 era, trust will be the defining characteristic of any successful attempt—digital or otherwise—to change behavior. In many developing markets, users are flooded—via WhatsApp messages, social networks, etc.—with a lot of information, and not all of it is based on science or best practice. For example, in certain Sub-Saharan African countries, there is a great deal of misinformation including the idea that people with black skin cannot get coronavirus. The basis of this myth is that COVID-19 hit predominately Asian, Arab, and “white” countries, and the first few cases were imported by people with the means to travel. There is a secondary undercurrent to this misinformation—that the virus cannot survive in hot temperatures, which accounts for most of sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the era of digital misinformation, users have to be able to trust the sources of their information, and this becomes all the more important when using digital channels, which are often impersonal or attempt to reach a wide variety of audiences at once. But trust is not simply a function of good audience segmentation. Digital communication channels must tap into and build on foundations created by real-life relationships, the kind that are created and fostered by agricultural extension networks, community savings and cooperative units, local civil society, and religious institutions. No attempt at quickly replicating these trust networks is likely to change the skepticism that often meets digital communications. The good news is that, in many cases, those same networks are also going online, adapting to the new reality. Building relationships with these networks to share and influence the behavior of target audiences will be critical, especially in the next few months of response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;complement-digital-campaigns-with-traditional-outreach&quot;&gt;Complement Digital Campaigns with Traditional Outreach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like the trust networks mentioned above, local media and advertising channels—radio stations, television channels, billboards, or other media—often have direct links to target audiences. While digital communication channels can be better targeted or more widely distributed, these traditional channels play a critical role in establishing trust and providing different ways to configure content, especially where long-form content is needed. For example, in Zambia, the Ministry of Health has worked with all three mobile networks to send daily WhatsApp messages to all its citizens. Included in these updates is the status of COVID-19 in Zambia, measures the government is taking, and specific measures individuals can take. Further, these text messages are translated into seven local languages and turned into radio/TV readers for national and community broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-digital-data-to-monitor-and-improve-campaigns&quot;&gt;Use Digital Data to Monitor and Improve Campaigns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital tools, in addition to being effective &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt; channels, can also serve as valuable &lt;em&gt;input&lt;/em&gt; channels for behavior change campaigns. By conducting baseline surveys (say, through texting) of current knowledge, attitudes, and behavior, programs can identify priorities, establish targets, and measure progress over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re glad that donors and implementers are beginning to incorporate digital tools into their COVID-19 response strategy, our philosophy remains pragmatic: Digital technologies are only one piece of the puzzle that must comprise the international community’s response to the pandemic. When they are well-designed, digital behavior change campaigns can turn everyday technologies of mobile phones and social networks into powerful, life-saving tools, even in the most difficult developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Promoting Resilient Ecosystems: How Cambodians are Adapting in the Face of COVID-19</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Five years in Cambodia leading the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/cambodia-development-innovations&quot;&gt;Development Innovations&lt;/a&gt; project taught me a lot about innovation. I saw innovators employ entrepreneurial thinking to develop out-of-the-box, creative solutions to problems, helping hundreds of thousands of Cambodians—automated phone calls warning people of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.development-innovations.org/blog/the-tech-mermaid-alert/&quot;&gt;coming floods&lt;/a&gt; comes to mind, as does a mobile &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edemy.org/#tesdopi&quot;&gt;test prep application&lt;/a&gt; to help high school students prepare for national exams. It’s this entrepreneurial thinking that the world desperately needs in this time of hardship, where livelihoods, the economy, and social cohesion are being challenged in unprecedented ways. Which naturally begs the question: In the face of COVID-19, what happens next in Cambodia’s innovation community?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Plan C: How Makerspaces are Providing a Stopgap for COVID-19 Supply Shortages</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the participants in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.development-innovations.org/success-stories/think-global-make-local-3d-printing-propels-young-cambodians-future/&quot;&gt;Think Global Make Local&lt;/a&gt; product development workshop, sponsored by our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/cambodia-development-innovations&quot;&gt;Cambodia Development Innovations&lt;/a&gt; project in 2016, created a design for a toy called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Doydoycompany/&quot;&gt;Doy Doy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. With &lt;em&gt;Doy Doy’s&lt;/em&gt; silicone straws and plastic connectors, kids can build complex structures. The product has gone on to achieve modest commercial success locally. I found &lt;em&gt;Doy Doy&lt;/em&gt; instructive because of the way its creator, Em Chanrithykol, ended up manufacturing the toy’s plastic connectors. Because of a lack of local injection-molding capacity and administrative barriers to importing parts made by contract manufacturers outside of Cambodia, Chanrithykol turned to a less traditional method: He contracted a local firm to churn out the parts on a battery of 3D printers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3D printing is slow, expensive, and inefficient. It is great for small runs of one-off items or prototypes, but it is a terrible way to mass manufacture a product. But the lesson of &lt;em&gt;Doy Doy&lt;/em&gt; is that a bad way to mass manufacture a product can still be better than having &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; way to mass manufacture a product. This is why I am currently manufacturing personal protective face shields for Baltimore-area hospitals in my basement.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Importance of Understanding Digital Divides During the COVID-19 Response</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Our work at DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration intersects with global COVID-19 responses in many ways. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/covid-19-data-analysis-part-1-demography-behavior-and-environment.html&quot;&gt;Earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, our data scientists presented an analysis of risk factors and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/COVID-looking-for-the-helpers-in-the-hardware-community.html&quot;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; we got a glimpse at the hardware community’s approach to the crisis. There is another element to our work that I think is critical to highlight—digital ecosystem assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unlocking the Value of Digital Transformation in the Social Sector</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For many years, the support of international donors to civil society organizations and private and public sectors in the technology field revolved around the provision of equipment, hardware, and software. On many occasions, these types of support have proved ineffective. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261263057_Overcoming_ICT_project_failures_-_A_practical_perspective&quot;&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; wrote in 2013, these investments quickly became obsolete or abandoned. Since then, we in the digital development community have supported international donors and international programming to better integrate technology into our work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Closing the Gender Digital Divide: What We’re Doing to Bring Women Online</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Digital technologies are revolutionizing the way we access information, financing, and networks—all critical tools for fully participating in the global economy. Yet, these technologies, most notably internet connectivity and mobile phones, are not reaching all people equally. In recognition of International Women’s Day, we are looking at one of the most pressing barriers women face to their economic advancement—the gender digital divide—and how DAI is addressing this problem through the U.S. Agency for International Development’s W-GDP&lt;a href=&quot;https://womenconnectchallenge.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/newsletter_final.pdf&quot;&gt; WomenConnect Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, implemented by DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df&quot;&gt;Digital Frontiers&lt;/a&gt; project. (For the latest information, please read our most recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://womenconnectchallenge.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/newsletter_final.pdf&quot;&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What are Cyber Harms and Why Are They Important for Digital Development?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, the digital landscape has significantly changed globally. First, and most obvious, the number of internet users has nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/273018/number-of-internet-users-worldwide/&quot;&gt;doubled&lt;/a&gt; from 2.8 billion to more than 4 billion in the last six years. Second, and perhaps a bit less obvious, the number of cyber incidents, such as data breaches or cybercrimes, impacting the average internet user, has grown exponentially. For a while now, I’ve been thinking about what these cybersecurity trends mean for our work in digital development. I recently read an article that helped frame the challenge in a way that is easily digestible, even by the least digitally focused development expert.&lt;/p&gt;
