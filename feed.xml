        <title>A Time of Change. And Reflection.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I can’t remember exactly what I was doing when the grenade went off up the street—probably brushing my teeth or something mundane like that. I was halfway through my two-week visit to Ethiopia and looking forward to getting out in the field. I was also completely unaware of what had just happened. It was a sobering day. I spent all afternoon watching the news. First one person confirmed dead, then two. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2018/06/23/622855931/grenade-attack-tears-through-rally-for-ethiopian-prime-minister&quot;&gt;One-hundred and fifty or so wounded&lt;/a&gt;. Fear on the faces of a populace that had recently been so full of hope.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Health in International Development: Using Tried &amp; Tested Technology Innovatively</title>

&lt;p&gt;I recently took part in the DAI panel discussion on “Digital Health in International Development: Current Realities and Future Trends” in London. It delivered fascinating perspectives from across the health, tech, and development sectors. Here’s a few key points I shared during the discussion and hope to stimulate a continued conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Catching Up with the Winners of MIT’s Grand Hack for Health</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) Grand Hack is &lt;em&gt;kind of a big deal.&lt;/em&gt; I don’t make the point as an affront to other hackathons—certainly not &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/top-3-climate-change-concepts-from-the-2016-nasa-space-apps-challenge-bogota.html&quot;&gt;DAI’s own&lt;/a&gt;—but not many other hackathons can claim to have generated more than $150 million in venture capital and spawned more than 40 viable companies. Those two facts qualify the Grand Hack for royalty status among hackathons, which makes it even more surprising that the event is run entirely by students, MIT’s Hacking Health group. It’s also the reason why I was so excited to get a taste of MIT’s secret innovation sauce from the inside—as a mentor, alongside my colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/kristen-roggemann&quot;&gt;Kristen Roggemann&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Coffee Cloud: The Digital Project for  Central American Coffee Growers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;From 2010 to 2014, the Central American coffee bean suffered from a disease that rocked the economies of the region. Exports declined by 55 percent. From 2012 to 2013 some 374,000 jobs were lost—17 percent of the labor force. &lt;strong&gt;Roya&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20171106-the-disease-that-could-change-how-we-drink-coffee&quot;&gt;coffee rust&lt;/a&gt; threatened the livelihoods of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/file_attachments/ib-coffee-rust-employment-collapse-central-america-140814-en.pdf&quot;&gt;nearly 2 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coffee rust is a fungal disease that covers the leaves and prevents photosynthesis, slowly constricting plants’ ability to process sunlight, reducing bean yield and eventually starving the plant to death. The warmer, wetter conditions wrought by climate change creates a better ecosystem for the fungus to grow. Its impact on Central American economies is significant as coffee exports are the region’s largest source of foreign income and coffee supports a vast supply chain, in turn supporting dozens of adjacent industries.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trends in Digital Health: 4 Takeaways From Our UK Event</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In comparison to other development sectors, health programs have historically been early adopters of digital tools. What have we learned over the last 10 years, and where are we heading? How can we build systems that integrate data from independent actors across the health ecosystem? How can we use lessons learned to support innovation? How can we adapt to expanding digital access and support the growth of local capacity?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Apply Now: Support USAID Missions to Improve Broadband Connectivity</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The rapid expansion of mobile and internet access in the developing world holds the promise of catalyzing resilient economic and social growth. However, the availability and cost of connectivity is a significant barrier to fully realizing that vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help address this challenge, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Center for Digital Development developed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/15396/Better_Connectivity_Better_Programs_April2018.pdf&quot;&gt;Better Connectivity, Better Programs: How to Implement a Demand Aggregation Program (How-to Guide)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Working With Tech Service Providers: It’s About More Than Tech</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you a nonprofit focused on improving maternal health outcomes? Or maybe you’re a civic engagement organization that encourages young people to become more involved with their local governments. No matter the objective, technology can both help you be more efficient internally and more impactful externally. The &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of tech is often easy: “Oh, we’ll just build an app for that!” But relationships with technical service providers are fraught with pitfalls that can jeopardize outcomes and derail even the best intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Recent Reads We Loved (And You May Have Missed!)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/news/dai-launches-the-center-for-digital-acceleration&quot;&gt;Center for Digital Acceleration&lt;/a&gt; team grows, we are finding new ways to share knowledge beyond our epic WhatsApp group chat that grows more ridiculous and off-topic by the day. We have some voracious readers on the team, so in prep for this post I took a minute to poll them to find out which recent articles they found fascinating—and I had missed them all! Since I can’t be the only one, I am sharing them with you to ensure these gems get as wide a readership as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
