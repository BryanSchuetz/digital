        <title>Forking a Live Tool with Design Thinking in Guatemala</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This past February I was back in Guatemala, working with the fine people of Chiantla to improve and iterate &lt;em&gt;Somos Chiantla&lt;/em&gt;. I was also in two new municipalities—Sacapulas and San Rafael Pie de la Cuesta—helping them create their own, personalized, forked versions of the app.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;When someone needs a website or mobile app, they search for a coder. Almost anyone can be trained to write code and enter the digital workforce—once there, opportunities abound: from helping businesses, governments and other organizations build the websites and apps they need to supporting the digital systems that power economies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blockchain for Development Part 2: Implementation Considerations</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As discussed in Part 1 of this two-part post on blockchain, “&lt;a href=&quot;/blockchain-for-development-part-1-understanding-the-tech.html&quot;&gt;Understanding the Tech&lt;/a&gt;,” the blockchain hype is pervasive in international development these days. It is my view that blockchain does not deserve the “Swiss army knife of new technology” label that has been thrust upon it. While blockchain is exciting and potentially very useful, appropriate application of the tech can be evasive. If you need a quick and simple run down of blockchain, check out &lt;a href=&quot;/blockchain-for-development-part-1-understanding-the-tech.html&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;. Here I will give you a glimpse of some of the potential uses for blockchain in global development programming, and some of the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blockchain for Development Part 1: Understanding the Tech</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin has launched the term “blockchain” into the world’s tech vernacular. Unfortunately for blockchain as a technology and a theory, it is often, for better or worse, synonymized with Bitcoin. Because of this, the ideas of public, transparent, and unchangeable information immediately come to mind as soon as someone mentions blockchain. While this is true for Bitcoin, this is not necessarily the case for all blockchains.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Putting Liberian Cities on the Map With OpenStreetMap</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the world becomes more urbanized, data on cities and the residents who inhabit them is key to building and governing sustainable communities. Yet this data is simply not available for many rural and urban areas around the world. Many cities lack base data sets—such as accurate maps of their cities that identify key infrastructure, services, and human settlements. In some cases, these maps exist on paper, but in other cases, are only available in closed, proprietary systems or not at all. This was the case in the Liberian cities of Ganta, Gbarnga, and Zwedru.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How a Pilot Project in Haiti Brings Optimism for Digitally Enabled Health System</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently presented during a TechChange course titled “The Future of Digital Health.” I was asked to discuss the implementation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/haiti-strategic-health-information-system-his-program&quot;&gt;Haiti Strategic Health Information System&lt;/a&gt; (HIS) program, a five-year, U.S. Agency for International Development-funded initiative that is consolidating and integrating Haiti’s disconnected health information assets. Preparing for this presentation gave me a chance to reflect on the past year—the progress we have made, the challenges we have encountered, and the future of digital health in Haiti.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Engage and Support Local Innovators: 3 Takeaways from the Digital Development Forum</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On March 9, I moderated a workshop called “How to Engage and Support Local Innovators” at the USAID &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitaldevelopment.org/digital-development-forum-2018&quot;&gt;Digital Development Forum&lt;/a&gt;. I was joined by three expert panelists: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielle-dhillon-a82a9859/&quot;&gt;Danielle Dhillon&lt;/a&gt; from the Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) at the UN Foundation; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonieliasz/&quot;&gt;Toni Eliasz&lt;/a&gt; from the World Bank’s Digital Entrepreneurship Program; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tylerradford/&quot;&gt;Tyler Radford&lt;/a&gt; from the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT). All three are focused on nurturing local technologists and innovators. Toni and Danielle support local startup ecosystems and Tyler builds communities of volunteer mappers. What have they learned through these efforts?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Playing The Right Role In Haiti’s Growing Mobile Sector: 4 Key Principles</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital financial services have been a robust part of the development sector for over a decade and their impact continues to grow. This blog post is part of a series produced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://mstarproject.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;mStar&lt;/a&gt; that focuses on successful projects that achieve results-driven impact in people’s lives. This post was originally published on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mstarproject.wordpress.com/2018/03/12/haitis-growing-mobile-sector/&quot;&gt;mStar digital development blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an exciting time for mobile money expansion in Haiti. Digicel’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQQFqoHzdo&quot;&gt;MonCash&lt;/a&gt;—Haiti’s largest mobile money deployment—has reached nearly 1 million customers and $400 million in yearly transacted value in 2017. This customer base represents a +1500 percent increase from 2015, the same year Digicel rebooted its strategy, marketing approach, product offering, and sales and training force.&lt;/p&gt;
