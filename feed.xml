        <title>Digital Asia Accelerator Cultivates Digital Skills for Cambodia’s Creative Sector</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Widespread digitalization has revolutionized almost every industry, including music and sound production. While rarely the focus of digital development initiatives, creative entrepreneurs such as artists and musicians in emerging economies have also found themselves scrambling to adapt to the ever-changing technology and social media landscapes. As such, this year, with funding from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Digital_Asia_Accelerator_Fact_Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Digital Asia Accelerator&lt;/a&gt; (DAA) initiative and as a part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/digital-connectivity-cybersecurity-partnership&quot;&gt;Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thesoundinitiative.com/&quot;&gt;The Sound Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (TSI)—a vocational program for musicians—launched the “Music 4.0” program to support Cambodian entrepreneurs striving to excel in this dynamic industry.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Report Offers Guidance to Support Agriculture Market Systems Actors During COVID-19</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Digital tools and services such as short message services (SMS), digitally enabled extension services, and artificial intelligence have helped market system actors in developing countries overcome common challenges in the agriculture sector, such as accessing weather information and diagnosing pest or disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the &lt;a href=&quot;https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/35216/9781464816574.pdf?sequence=2&amp;amp;isAllowed=y&quot;&gt;documented value&lt;/a&gt; of these innovations, uptake of digital agriculture technology still is not widespread. A lack of affordable and accessible technologies, poor connectivity, high costs of data, and social stigmas around digital technology can be major barriers to potential users. With COVID-19 making digital connectivity critical to economic activities, development stakeholders have spent the past year and a half assessing the relationship between the pandemic and the adoption and use of digital agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Five Tools to Foster Creative Innovation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When we peel back the planning, strategy design, project management, and technical implementation layers of any creation, we see something more intuitive. More human. And that’s the desire to “create.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terms such as “innovation,” “research and development,” and “discovery” capture the adventure of the creative process. But garnering that same intensity in a workplace, let alone one’s personal life is not always the most accessible trail. In this post, I dive into some tools we employ as a team to foster creative innovation while also making reflections from another part of my life as a musician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a musician, I’ve gone through many periods of creative productivity. “Writer’s block,” as some may relate to, is the most frustrating. A quick online search generates tons of books on how to overcome creative dry spells. Meditation, exercise, and just taking a good ol’ break are some of the well-known remedies. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned from songwriting and performing, it’s that the creative process requires gentle nurturing. And just like music production, technology product development is no stranger to creative dry spells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what are some of the tools we employ as a team to foster creative technology product development?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Digital Climate Risk Assessment Tools Help Unclog Climate Finance Flows in Emerging Economies</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional lending channels are blocking access to climate finance. The large commercial banks that receive funds from investment banks accredited by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenclimate.fund/&quot;&gt;Green Climate Fund&lt;/a&gt; typically seek smaller financial institutions in local markets to distribute these funds. However, these smaller institutions often lack the tools needed to appraise risk and begin lending, meaning that funds that have been allocated towards climate mitigation, resilience building, and adaptation efforts are not being efficiently disseminated.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reflecting on the Role of Digital Solutions in Tackling USAID’s Global Priorities</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As most people in the international development community know, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/organization/samantha-power&quot;&gt;Samantha Power&lt;/a&gt;, former U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations under President Barack Obama, was nominated and officially sworn in as the 19th Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) on May 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During her confirmation hearing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/032321_Power_Testimony.pdf&quot;&gt;testimony&lt;/a&gt;, she acknowledged the longstanding priorities of USAID that would remain at the fore, such as women’s empowerment, food security, education, and global health, but also cited four particularly pressing and consequential global issues on which USAID would focus in the years ahead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Climate change&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conflict and state collapse&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Democratic backsliding&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about these priorities and what they mean for development work in the coming years, I thought about how digital solutions fit into this picture. Though not called out specifically in her testimony, digital technologies will serve a critical role in ensuring the success and effectiveness of these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Request for Information: Exploring the Role of AI and Automation on Agrifood Systems</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are rapidly evolving to include more complex and advanced tasks. As a result, the number of meaningful use cases relevant to the development sector are expanding and demonstrate significant potential to solve some of the world’s most prominent challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What We Learned From a Deep Dive into the World of Prizes and Challenges</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, our colleagues at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USAID_Digital_Asia_Accelerator_Fact_Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;Digital Asia Accelerator&lt;/a&gt; buy-in under the Digital Frontiers project asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/authors/alexander-sekhniashvili/&quot;&gt;Alex Sekhniashvili&lt;/a&gt; and I to identify and synthesize lessons learned administering prizes and challenges across the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) portfolio. Given DAI’s long history implementing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-grand-challenges-development-implementation-services&quot;&gt;Grand Challenges for Development Implementation Services&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-center-development-innovation-professional-management-services&quot;&gt;Center for Development Innovation (CDI) Professional Management Services,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df&quot;&gt;Digital Frontiers&lt;/a&gt; projects on behalf of USAID—there are quite a lot of lessons! So Alex and I dove deep into the world of prizes and challenges, reading project documents and interviewing a number of DAI staff. Read below some of our findings.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Platform Unites Afghan Activists</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since 2015, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/afghanistan-musharikat&quot;&gt;Promote: Musharikat&lt;/a&gt; program has been promoting the meaningful civic participation of Afghan women. To date, more than 7,000 activists and 370 civil society organizations (CSO), across all 34 of Afghanistan’s provinces, have chosen to join DAI-led Musharikat to advance women’s equality and empowerment. By working through coalitions, Musharikat brings together citizen activists, government officials, religious scholars, and a diverse assemblage of CSOs to bolster both the supply and demand for women’s rights in Afghanistan. Though each coalition has a specific mandate, their shared vision of a peaceful, inclusive, and equitable country provides a common cause for action. This mission includes public awareness campaigns, building the capacity of those championing change, and working with government institutions to vigorously enforce and reform laws to fulfill their duty to the nation’s largest underserved constituency—women.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Job Postings from Mexico's Energy Sector Reveal About the State of Clean Energy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A significant challenge to achieving the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals&quot;&gt;Sustainable Development Goals&lt;/a&gt; has been measuring country progress in the transition to renewable and clean energy sources. While expert surveys or legislation enacted may provide some insight into how countries are progressing on the whole, they lack the granularity to inform us about subnational trends, skills in-demand, and the presence of firms and subsectors within each country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One useful way to explore these factors is by analyzing data available from job search engines and using keywords related to the energy sector. These can provide insights on how jobs in key sectors and subsectors evolve over time, what the demand for labor among firms in the energy sector is, where these openings and firms are located, and how they differ in terms of skills sought in the labor market.&lt;/p&gt;
