        <title>A Resolution to Support the Tech Sector Where We Need It Most</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On January 5, I posted the message below on Facebook to hold myself accountable to my New Year’s resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/uploads/hanson%20blog%20pic-3811e6.png&quot; alt=&quot;hanson blog pic-3811e6.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s simple. I want tech businesses to grow and thrive in Nigeria &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of Lagos. I want to support someone who grew up in, works in, and wants to continue working in my hometown, Uyo. This is not just my resolution, but has been my life’s work since I started &lt;a href=&quot;https://starthub.com.ng/&quot;&gt;Start Innovation Hub&lt;/a&gt; five years ago. Start Innovation Hub is an ICT firm and innovation lab that works to expand the tech industry by supporting tech startups and talented individuals in Uyo. We build skills and connect entrepreneurs to economic opportunities, as well as support local businesses by developing software solutions. You can’t deny that the tech sector in Nigeria is growing rapidly, but the concentration of firms in Lagos means that places like Uyo are left behind. Through Start Up Innovation Hub, I hope to change that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Four Rs: An Interview With the Lean Research Initiative</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We are huge fans of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://d-lab.mit.edu/research/lean-research&quot;&gt;Lean Research&lt;/a&gt; initiative at DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/digital-acceleration&quot;&gt;Center for Digital Acceleration&lt;/a&gt;. I recently went to the Massachusetts Institute for Technology’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://d-lab.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;MIT D-Lab&lt;/a&gt; and sat with &lt;a href=&quot;https://d-lab.mit.edu/research/lean-research/lean-research-community&quot;&gt;Elizabeth, Kendra, and Kim&lt;/a&gt;, the team behind Lean Research, to learn more about the genesis of the initiative and what tools and resources they offer ICT4D practitioners eager to “right-size” their own research approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Citizen-Centered Design and Frontier Insights in Kabul</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Center for Digital Acceleration is excited to announce that we’re taking &lt;em&gt;MiMuni&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/munis-transparencia-gobierno-abierto/municipalidad-de-chiantla&quot;&gt;open-source&lt;/a&gt; transparency and citizen participation application developed for Guatemalan municipalities, and replicating it for five municipalities in Afghanistan through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/afghanistan-strong-hubs-afghan-hope-and-resilience-shahar&quot;&gt;Strong Hubs for Afghan Hope and Resilience (SHAHAR)&lt;/a&gt; project, which is funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development. The first iteration will be with the Municipality of Kabul.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Data, Analysis, and Information (Not as Boring as It Sounds)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t excited by the headline—you should be! In this blog I will highlight a few issues I run across when discussing projects or planning data analytics solutions. Going into the details of each of them would take quite some time, so I will keep the anecdotes (data?) brief. There will undoubtedly be many interpretations of the data -&amp;gt; analytics -&amp;gt; insights/information flow, but this blog is simply an opportunity for me to share my own thoughts. After all, what are we as good data stewards and scientists without proper debate?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Powering Women’s Entrepreneurship in Cambodia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/uploads/lida.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;lida.jpg&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; style=&quot;width: 35%;&quot; /&gt;
Meet Lida Loem. Lida is the co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sheinvestments.com/&quot;&gt;SHE Investments&lt;/a&gt;, a social enterprise that helps Cambodian women turn their entrepreneurship skills up to 11 (yes, out of 10) with training, mentorship and networking in both cities and rural regions of Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHE’s vision is a world where investments in women in developing countries are seen as opportunity, not charity. They work with current and aspiring entrepreneurs across Cambodia, and see themselves as a catalyst for women’s economic empowerment through increased income generation and employment opportunities. Their work helps to bridge the gender gap in business and entrepreneurship, strengthening and diversifying Cambodia’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Human-Centered Design for a Digital Farmer Business School Application: A One-Day Roadmap</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Human-centered design (HCD) is a central focus of DAI’s. We’ve written extensively about how we work with our partners to follow this complex and time-consuming (but very important) process and even came up with a more concise, budget-friendly &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/dai-launches-human-centered-design-whitepaper.html&quot;&gt;Lean HCD approach.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of our continued commitment to the approach, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/authors/&quot;&gt;Karim Bin-Humam&lt;/a&gt; and I recently traveled to Ghana to run a workshop on HCD for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ssab-africa.net/&quot;&gt;Sustainable Smallholder Agribusiness Programme (SSAB),&lt;/a&gt; implemented by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was lean HCD on steroids: We asked participants to produce a HCD roadmap in just one day.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Meet the 9 WomenConnect Winners Who Are Using Tech for Good</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Choosing just nine shining examples from more than 500 applicants of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/wcc&quot;&gt;WomenConnect Challenge&lt;/a&gt; was no easy task. The global call—put out in March by Ivanka Trump and USAID Administrator Mark Green—sought examples of the changing ways in which women and girls’ access and use of technology help drive quality health, better education, and improved livelihoods for themselves and their families.&lt;/p&gt;

The cyber training was intended to equip foreign service officers with the knowledge and tools to represent the broad range of policy priorities enumerated in the President’s International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Getting the Basics of ICT4D Right</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a tendency in any field of business (and life!) to focus on the newest, shiniest objects. Just like obsession over the release of the latest iPad, the ICT4D community holds a special place in its heart for the newest technology offerings. Machine learning, blockchain, and the internet of things (IoT) come to mind today, whereas in years past it was crowdsourcing, social media, or smart phones.&lt;/p&gt;
