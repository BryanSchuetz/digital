        <title>Localizing Digital Public Goods</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DAI is pleased to announce the release of its latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/digital-acceleration-solutions/cda-insights&quot;&gt;CDA Insights&lt;/a&gt; paper, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/Localizing%20Digital%20Public%20Goods.pdf&quot;&gt;Localizing Digital Public Goods&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global donors and development implementers are increasingly aligned around the theory that digital investments are most effective and equitable when owned by local stakeholders who can leverage the full potential of digital technologies and data. They are also embracing an agenda of “localization” to prioritize local digital ownership, expertise, and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Social Media for Civic Education: Challenges and Opportunities in Cambodia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abby Edwards, Aishwarya Jadav, Arin Kerstein, Alvin Siagian, and Shuyang Wang are second-year master’s students in the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies international development program. They worked with DAI from September 2022 to April 2023 on the Innovations for Social Accountability in Cambodia (ISAC) project, implemented by FHI 360 and funded by U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), to conduct an assessment of the Cambodian digital ecosystem and the digitalization of ISAC partner civil society organizations (CSOs). The team interviewed civic engagement experts, Cambodian CSOs working to implement the ISAC project, international organizations working in Cambodia, Cambodian content creators, and citizens in multiple ISAC target provinces. This post summarizes their key findings and recommendations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Some Spider-Sense to Kick Off 20 More Years of Cybersecurity Awareness</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the fifth in a series of blog posts about cybersecurity to mark Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October. This blog first appeared in the &lt;strong&gt;Tech Policy Press&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://techpolicy.press/some-spider-sense-to-kick-off-20-more-years-of-cybersecurity-awareness/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Spiderman,” as he was dubbed, worked for military intelligence as an undercover volunteer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As told by Nathan Thornburgh in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep590/05au/readings/titan.rain.htm&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Spiderman, later identified as Shawn Carpenter—a U.S. intel contractor by day—watched by night as hackers breached networks of the U.S. military and made off with uncommon stealth. Spiderman “clung unseen to the walls of their chat rooms and servers,” following the stolen files from site to site, landing him virtually in China’s Guangdong province. When his private-sector employers found out what he was doing, they fired Carpenter and stripped him of his top-secret clearance for “inappropriate” after-hours sleuthing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, in October 2004, a small nonprofit called the National Cyber Security Alliance, together with the new U.S. Department of Homeland Security, proclaimed the first National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. Their message: Update your antivirus software twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safe to say, cybersecurity awareness has come a long way since Spiderman got sacked.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>4 Key Takeaways from DAI’s Cybersecurity Programs in Southeast Asia and Mongolia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the fourth in a series of blog posts about cybersecurity to mark Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber threats in Southeast Asia are on the rise. Data from Singapore’s Ministry of Defense shows that cybercrime in the region &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2023/07/18/asia-pacific/asean-cyberattacks-operations-center/&quot;&gt;increased by 82 percent&lt;/a&gt; between 2021 and 2022. To help counter these growing threats, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Digital Asia Accelerator (DAA) initiative, implemented by DAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df&quot;&gt;Digital Frontiers&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/digital-connectivity-and-cybersecurity-partnership/&quot;&gt;Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership (DCCP)&lt;/a&gt;, promotes cybersecurity awareness and capacity building in Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Mongolia, Myanmar, and Thailand. Since 2019, DAA has implemented several &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ictworks.org/effective-cybersecurity-awareness-programs/&quot;&gt;cybersecurity awareness initiatives&lt;/a&gt; in the region. Drawing on these experiences, here are four of our key takeaways on how to create an enabling environment for better cybersecurity awareness, defense, and opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Have We Learned in the Past Five Years about Cybersecurity?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the third in a series of blog posts about cybersecurity to mark Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For digital development practitioners, cybersecurity is now in the digital development zeitgeist. Over the past five years or so, it has become an important standalone technical area, as well as a critical building block of all our interventions. In honor of Cybersecurity Awareness Month, I wanted to revisit Digital@DAI’s earliest posts about cybersecurity from 2018 to see how our initial thinking holds up against a 2023 mindset. Our first-ever series on cybersecurity introduced the concept of cybersecurity to digital development practitioners by doing three things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/cybersecurity-series-part-1-trust-is-why-cyber-security-matters-to-digital-development.html?utm_source=related-box&quot;&gt;Providing a technical explanation&lt;/a&gt; of cybersecurity and linking it to the concept of trust;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/cyber-security-2.html&quot;&gt;Examining cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt; through the lens of regulations, skills, and institutions, aligned to the World Bank’s 2016 &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/896971468194972881/pdf/102725-PUB-Replacement-PUBLIC.pdf&quot;&gt;Digital Dividends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; report, and;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-digital.com/cyber-security-series-part-3-pirated-software.html&quot;&gt;Examining the topic&lt;/a&gt; of pirated software at the micro level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>How Cybersecurity Literacy Can Help People Counter Disinformation and Exercise their Human Rights</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the second in a series of blog posts about cybersecurity to mark Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2022&quot;&gt;2022 Threat Landscape Report&lt;/a&gt; published by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) highlights the spread of disinformation as one of the top eight cybersecurity &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20220120STO21428/cybersecurity-main-and-emerging-threats&quot;&gt;threats&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/Disinformation-Primer.pdf&quot;&gt;Disinformation Primer&lt;/a&gt; defines disinformation as information that is shared with the intent to mislead people. As the world becomes more digitally connected and as digital technologies become more integrated into different aspects of daily life, it is important to understand the impact of digital disinformation. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disinformation can cause people to stop trusting the institutions and systems that assist them in exercising their fundamental human rights.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Citizens who do not trust their electoral systems will be deterred from exercising their right to vote.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business owners who are hesitant to use digital technologies will find it harder to earn a good income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Unlocking the Potential of Generative AI in Cybersecurity: A Roadmap to Opportunities and Challenges</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the first in a series of blog posts about cybersecurity to mark Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a fascinating field that is taking the world by storm. It is a cutting-edge technology that allows algorithms to create new and unique data, which was unimaginable just a few years ago. While traditional AI models are designed to recognize and classify existing patterns, generative AI models are trained to generate new patterns and unique output data. With generative AI, the possibilities are endless—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F&quot;&gt;MidJourney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/dall-e-2&quot;&gt;DALL-E&lt;/a&gt; create art, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/auth/login&quot;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; writes compelling pieces of text that are nearly indistinguishable from those created by humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine the potential of this technology in industries such as healthcare and cybersecurity, where it can be used to create new and innovative solutions to existing problems. The possibilities are truly endless, and we are only at the beginning of this exciting journey. However, despite offering exciting opportunities and applications in cybersecurity, generative AI comes with its challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Government-Run Digital Tools to Combat Corruption: Can They Work?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Originally &lt;a href=&quot;https://dai-global-developments.com/articles/government-run-digital-tools-to-combat-corruption-can-they-work/&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; on DAI’s Developments blog.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014 and early 2015, more than 3,000 volunteers peered into their monitors to try and decipher poorly handwritten and scanned &lt;a href=&quot;https://star.worldbank.org/focus-area/asset-declarations?ref=pubs.ghost.io&quot;&gt;annual asset declarations&lt;/a&gt; from Ukrainian officials that described their properties, vehicles, land, commercial venues, bank accounts, and cash. It was a tedious task. At times, it seemed that civil servants deliberately used bad handwriting to comply with the requirements of paper-based transparency. By 2022, before the full-scale war, any internet user would have free access to more than 2.5 million asset declarations searchable through the public registry of the National Agency for Prevention of Corruption of Ukraine and at least one advanced civil society powered instrument that worked on the data-fuel from this registry. The difference was night and day. Now, instead of peering into illegible scans of handwritten scribbles, with a click of a button you can check whether a company owned by civil servant John Doe won any government contracts last year, and whether his elderly parents bought a mansion close to the capital or a new luxury car—and ask questions to the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments worldwide are rushing to use digital technology to reduce corruption. Over the past decade, state agencies have increasingly used digital systems to conduct anti-corruption investigations, gather and analyze asset declarations, automate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dai.com/uploads/E-Procurement%20pages.pdf?ref=pubs.ghost.io&quot;&gt;electronic procurement processes&lt;/a&gt;, and analyze open data. Despite initial implementation difficulties in many countries, these digital tools have &lt;a href=&quot;https://star.worldbank.org/publications/automated-risk-analysis-asset-and-interest-declarations-public-officials?ref=pubs.ghost.io&quot;&gt;proven effective&lt;/a&gt;. Many governments that benefit from donor assistance are now asking to prioritize resources for upgrading or building new IT systems to help counter corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
