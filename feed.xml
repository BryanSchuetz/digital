        <title>Advances in ICT Connectivity Highlight Need for Digital Safety Preparedness in Pacific Communities</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pacific Islands have the lowest rate of mobile &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pacificislandtimes.com/post/2020/01/04/the-connectivity-gap-in-the-pacific&quot;&gt;internet penetration&lt;/a&gt; in the world and fixed broadband connection levels far below that of their neighbors. Recent and planned investments in building out undersea fiber optic cable and satellite services—including those financed by the United Nations, World Bank, and Asian Development Bank—are striving to change this, boosting internet speeds and expanding access to citizens, governments, and businesses across the region. In recent weeks I’ve spoken with a number of experts in the Pacific Islands about their concerns and priorities around this topic. Below are a few common themes that resonated throughout my conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Are We Reading about Technology and Ethics?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Tech ethics have continued to claim the public spotlight as more accounts of bias and harm due to technology and artificial intelligence (AI) have appeared in the media. Stories from racial bias in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03228-6&quot;&gt;health care algorithms&lt;/a&gt; to gender bias in &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/article/amazon-sexist-recruiting-algorithm-gender-bias-ai/&quot;&gt;hiring algorithms&lt;/a&gt; have uncovered the lack of neutrality in technology that has previously been assumed to be completely objective and neutral.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Satellite Imagery and ‘Light at Night’ Helps Development Practitioners Estimate GDP</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am sure many of you have come across a map like the one below. I find that images of our planet are always awe-inspiring and this image is certainly not an exception. I can easily get lost in satellite imagery for hours if I am not careful. Most of those images are based on visual spectrum optical technology (LandSAT, Sentinel, etc.), thus requiring daylight for the powerful digital cameras to “see.” Remote sensing satellites such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncc.nesdis.noaa.gov/VIIRS/&quot;&gt;VIIRS&lt;/a&gt;—which DAI uses for its analysis—are equipped with special infrared equipment and able to capture beautiful images of the earth at night!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Innovator Series: Talking Girls in Tech with Voneat Pen</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kate Heuisler recently spoke with Voneat Pen, the Chapter Ambassador for &lt;a href=&quot;https://technovationcambodia.com/&quot;&gt;Technovation&lt;/a&gt; in Cambodia, about her work growing the successful all-girl tech entrepreneurship education program for the seventh year in a row. While juggling her roles as the co-founder of the tech startup &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/606Digital/&quot;&gt;606&lt;/a&gt;, a programmer, and STEM advocate, Voneat has been instrumental to Technovation’s success during its most challenging years. When COVID-19 pushed the program online overnight, the Technovation community (and its partners) were still able to successfully engage new all-girl teams, mentors, schools, and provinces across the country. To date, Technovation has helped connect more than 2,000 Cambodian girls to essential 21st-century tech creator skills.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an excerpt from that interview.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fast Company's World Changing Ideas Awards Highlight Opportunities for Digital Development</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Fast Company magazine has been around for decades…but is it relevant for digital development work? The publication was founded in 1995 at a time when business was changing the world in new ways. Today, 26 years later, we are still coming to terms with the ways that technologies are transforming the ways we work and live—especially during the COVID-19 global pandemic. As I work with clients and projects focused on digital development, the businesses and organizations featured in Fast Company offer new ideas, inspiration, and out-of-the-box thinking to those of us heads down in global development projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I wanted to share some of the winners of Fast Company’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90623897&quot;&gt;2021 World-Changing Ideas Awards&lt;/a&gt;—and how these innovations could apply to our work. World Changing Ideas is one of Fast Company’s major annual awards programs and is focused on social good, seeking to elevate finished products and brave concepts that make the world better.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Research Explores Digital Technologies and Their Impact on Social Accountability in Southeast Asia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ian Cocroft, Karen Lee, and Connor MacKenzie are second-year master’s students in the international development program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). The SAIS International Development (IDEV) practicum allows students to work directly with public, private, and nongovernmental organizations as a capstone to their graduate studies. Ian, Karen, and Connor worked with the Center for Digital Acceleration at DAI. The students conducted virtual research in Burma, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam during the 2020-21 academic year to better understand how civil society organizations (CSOs) use digital technologies to support social accountability in public service delivery. The team’s final report provides DAI with considerations on how CSOs can better integrate digital technologies into their operations and highlights regional examples of digital tools for social accountability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our practicum team worked with DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration on a regional study about how CSOs in Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam use digital technologies for social accountability in public service delivery, providing a series of recommendations for the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fhi360.org/projects/innovations-social-accountability-cambodia-isac&quot;&gt;Innovations for Social Accountability in Cambodia (ISAC) program&lt;/a&gt;. As part of our research, we undertook an extensive literature review and held Zoom interviews with country representatives from CSOs, tech organizations, and multilateral institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Right to Repair is a Development Issue</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Who owns the device you are reading this blog post on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem like a straightforward question until a power surge fries a key circuit or a stray elbow knocks a unit to the floor. At this point, the process of repairing what you thought was your (or your employer’s) property is likely to get a bit more complicated: The device turns out to be held together with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Proprietary_head&quot;&gt;proprietary screws&lt;/a&gt;, contains deliberately unobtainable spare parts, has software locks that cannot be overridden without the manufacturer’s express permission, or other random features included specifically to seal you out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Apply Now to Support USAID Missions through Digital Agriculture Ecosystem Assessments</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the incredible progress made over the last decade by the U.S. Government’s global hunger and food security &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.feedthefuture.gov/&quot;&gt;Feed the Future&lt;/a&gt; program, continued shocks, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/organization/bureaus/bureau-resilience-and-food-security/responding-to-covid-19-impact-on-resilience-and-food-security&quot;&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, make the work towards a more resilient global population and improved food security more relevant than ever. COVID’s impact on food security continues to be revealed but it’s estimated that 124 million more people experienced long-lasting poverty and hunger in 2020 and that 2.6 million more children will face stunting due to the pandemic. Across the globe, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is working to address these impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Transition from a Tech Company to DAI</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Before joining DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration (CDA), I worked in the software development industry. For the majority of my 15 years in this field, I only worked for tech companies whose main business model was building software. To successfully build software, there are multiple practices and skills that companies need. These skills are, for example, agile methodologies and good coding practices (such as patterns and documentation) that often vary from company to company and the type of technology used. Other practices include daily meetings and specialized resources for each phase of the software development process. In addition, there are roles such as back-end developers, front-end developers, DevOps, scrum masters, graphic designers, UX designers, and more! From this, you can see there is a lot that goes into making even a small web application. But, what I have just described is the experience of working on very large teams that only make software, which is very different from work within CDA’s Products team.&lt;/p&gt;
