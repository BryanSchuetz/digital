  summary: "Despite the incredible progress made over the last decade by the U.S. Government’s global hunger and food security Feed the Future program, continued shocks, including the COVID-19 pandemic, make the work towards a more resilient global population and improved food security more relevant than ever. COVID’s impact on food security continues to be revealed but it’s estimated that 124 million more people experienced long-lasting poverty and hunger in 2020 and that 2.6 million more children will face stunting due to the pandemic. Across the globe, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is working to address these impacts."

  summary: "Before joining DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration (CDA), I worked in the software development industry. For the majority of my 15 years in this field, I only worked for tech companies whose main business model was building software. To successfully build software, there are multiple practices and skills that companies need. These skills are, for example, agile methodologies and good coding practices (such as patterns and documentation) that often vary from company to company and the type of technology used. Other practices include daily meetings and specialized resources for each phase of the software development process. In addition, there are roles such as back-end developers, front-end developers, DevOps, scrum masters, graphic designers, UX designers, and more! From this, you can see there is a lot that goes into making even a small web application. But, what I have just described is the experience of working on very large teams that only make software, which is very different from work within CDA’s Products team."

  summary: "As part of last year’s launch events for the DAI Center for Digital Acceleration’s flagship Frontier Insights research on user perceptions of trust and privacy on the internet, two panels of experts helped underscore and widen the discussion around issues raised in the report. In the South Asia panel, a theme that emerged very clearly was the urgent need to build digital skills as a means to develop and maintain trust in digital services. Both the research and expert discussion highlighted the need for a multi-stakeholder approach to enable informed use and trust throughout the digital value chain.

  summary: "As we head into “event season”—albeit remotely—I’ve been thinking about how we share knowledge about what we do in the ICT4D space.

In doing some recent research and sector mapping, I noted how different the levels of ICT4D development are amongst various sectors. In digital agriculture, it is generally accepted that there are numerous innovations out there and a plethora of pilot projects, but many are struggling to bring these innovations to scale. Many programs might be integrating digital as a pilot here and there, but struggling to identify what works and how they can reach the program goals. There are a huge number of initiatives seeking to share lessons within sectors, but how many are taking lessons from sector to sector?"

  summary: "I’ve spent a lot of my time over the past few months thinking about online shopping. Not only because with the arrival of my second child my Amazon purchases have skyrocketed (although they have), but because DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration has been doing a lot of work alongside our clients digging into how small to medium-size businesses use digital technologies in this digital-forward—often digital-only era of COVID-19. It’s fascinating work and has revealed to me how little I previously knew of social storefronts. My hunch is that many of my peers in digital development are equally unaware of the myriad features, tools, and functions embedded in the business accounts of the ubiquitous social media apps we engage with daily, and we have some work to do to understand, and appropriately utilize, these extremely powerful platforms for economic growth."

  summary: "Agile methodology has been a trending topic for a while now and it typically describes a wide range of approaches to software development, project management, and even raising children. Everyone loves to say they work on an agile team or to describe their company as an agile organization. While it’s true that its widespread use has changed the way people work, the details around agile have started to become diluted to the point where no one really knows what it means anymore. The Agile Alliance, an organization that supports those who use Agile, defines it broadly as “the ability to create and respond to change.” This post is the first in a series aimed at unpacking this buzzword and how the set of ideas it represents can be used effectively in international development contexts."

  link: "https://dai-global-digital.com/five-fresh-tips-to-make-digital-safety-cool-again-a-case-study-from-thailand.html?utm_source=daidotcom"
  summary: "Southeast Asia is one of the world’s fastest-growing regions for digital connectivity. Thai people, for example, spend on average nine hours a day using the internet on their mobile phones. That’s the second highest in the world! And 95 percent of all Thais connected to the internet use Facebook.



We have all heard about the dangers that come with using social media—misinformation, privacy concerns, and cyber bullying—just to name a few. But people in Thailand, like many places around the world, are still very invested in social media platforms, despite the challenges. So how might we turn this challenge into an opportunity?

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and DAI are collaborating with Facebook Thailand, Love Frankie, a local social change agency, and 400 university students around the country in the Wai Kid Digital Challenge to demystify digital safety and citizenship and educate the public about positive online communication, identity and security, news literacy, and critical thinking through creative videos.

Here are five fresh tips we have learned from the Challenge so far to make sure your next digital safety activity delivers results."

  summary: "For some professions, the past year has normalized virtual interactions and digital collaboration. While many jobs and activities still require in-person interaction, others have moved online as much as possible. Conferences are virtual. Weekly meetings take place through a screen. And classrooms have gone online.

Most people who have engaged with learning this past year have had some kind of digital experience. This is true across all ages—and, we have seen, often with mixed success. Nevertheless, at our Center for Digital Acceleration, we know that, as the saying goes—“the show must go on”—and we have done our best to help DAI’s projects around the globe make their in-person courses and activities come alive in our virtual world. In this post, we offer some brief reflections on the different types of online training our projects are developing, and then ask the question: is this the new normal?"

  summary: "With March being Women’s History Month, it feels appropriate to reflect on progress made towards the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal No. 5: Achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls. Over the years, development programs have made significant strides in recognizing and alleviating the inequality that exists between men and women worldwide, though there is still much to be done. From DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration’s perspective, it is particularly important to highlight the disparities that exist in the realm of digital tools and opportunities. In today’s world, where access to the internet and digital applications is increasingly valuable for both personal and professional purposes, female empowerment efforts must include the prioritization of women’s digital access, literacy, and inclusion."

  summary: "I find it difficult to use the word in this context, but there may be one positive—if not collateral—effect of COVID-19: after the decades of support the digital development community has provided to businesses and consumers around the world to help, the adoption of digital technologies has accelerated in mere months. There’s a new willingness to embrace the digital economy, as restrictions against in-person interactions move people online and require the use of digital tools out of necessity. This process, often called digital transformation, has been discussed by a variety of sources, outlining both its benefits and risks. We thought it might be helpful to provide an overview of some of the articles, blogs, and resources we are reading to leverage this momentum. This list is by no means exhaustive, but rather provides a few highlights to get you started. I’ve broken down the readings into three, highly academic categories: 1. This is really happening, 2. and the benefits could be huge, 3. but please do not forget the risks."

  summary: "I was recently cleaning my house when I came across three old mobile phones: a feature phone, a BlackBerry, and an iPhone. I found myself wondering, “Why did I keep these?” Immediately, I thought, “the pictures,” but then quickly remembered that nowadays when everything can be saved to the cloud, that justification makes no sense. When I finished organizing, I found that I had left the three phones on my desk, as if they were patiently waiting for me to do something with them. It quickly dawned on me that I actually did not know what to do with them… not from a sentimental perspective, but rather from a lack of knowledge of how to securely dispose of technology. Shouldn’t many of the pieces and parts be reusable to build new devices or maintain old ones? Is there an equivalent to an electronics recycling bin?"

  summary: "We recently spoke with Sotheavy AT, the Founder of Think Plastic, a hugely popular digital environmental advocacy campaign working to reduce plastic waste and inspire action from citizens across Cambodia. (She’s also the former Senior Innovation Program Manager for the DAI-led Development Innovations, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and a consultant on DAI projects across Southeast Asia.) Think Plastic started small, with two- to three-minute videos in 2019, and has grown rapidly to reach more than 4 million Cambodians in just one year—almost 25 percent of the population of the country. As more businesses, organizations, and citizens go online around the world in the COVID-19 era, we have seen evidence of how well-designed and well-executed online campaigns can rapidly advance development outcomes. Think Plastic has been widely recognized for its success by the Royal Government of Cambodia’s Ministry of Environment and the Women of the Future Southeast Asia and is now a well-known brand across the country. This is an excerpt from that interview."

  summary: "In November 2020, Masakhane, a grassroots natural language process (NLP) community whose “mission is to strengthen and spur NLP in African languages, for Africans, by Africans,” published a paper titled “Participatory Research for Low-resourced Machine Translation: A Case Study in African Languages.” Machine translation refers to the use of software to translate digital and nondigital text and speech from one language into another. Google Translate is one of the more common examples of machine translation. Most of us have experienced issues translating text, especially sentences and phrases, as Google Translate often has difficulty detecting meaning and context. Due to these challenges, it can often give users incorrect word-for-word translations. (In your free time, search for the #GoogleTranslateFail hashtag on Twitter for a whole host of mistranslated content and a good laugh.)

Google Translate, and other mainstream machine translation tools, are also limited in the number of languages they are able to translate. As of today, Google Translate offers support for only 108 of the more than 7,000 languages spoken across the globe. Many of the languages that are not supported are what machine learning researchers consider to be “low-resourced,” a term used to describe languages that have few digital resources available and, more importantly, that are less commonly taught, endangered, or low density. The Masakhane paper outlines an alternative “participatory” approach for low-resourced languages to standard NLP tasks such as crowd-sourced annotation for training data and evaluation benchmarks. To learn more about the basics of NLP, head to our previous blog post on the importance of NLP in development."

  summary: "In an astonishing letter to the editor published in the December 17, 2020, edition of the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), a group of five doctors from the University of Michigan Medical School presented findings from their study on adult inpatients receiving supplemental oxygen at the University’s hospital. They found that the variance between blood oxygen levels measured through a pulse oximeter—an optical device that estimates blood oxygen by analyzing the light absorbed in an extremity, usually a finger—and more rigorous (and invasive) analyses of arterial blood gas differed substantially depending on whether the patient was Black or white. Moreover, Black patients tended to get more optimistic readings from the oximeter. Such inaccuracies could quite possibly lead to worse clinical outcomes and could be particularly detrimental when treating COVID-19 as careful monitoring of patients’ blood oxygen levels can trigger lifesaving medical care.

Against the backdrop of the ongoing global conversation about racism and bias, one might ask whether the pulse oximeters in this study are racist. Can a piece of hardware even be racist?"
