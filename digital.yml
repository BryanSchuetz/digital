  summary: "TikTok—the popular short video-sharing app—is now the fastest-growing social media platform on the internet. Rivaling companies such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Netflix, the controversial platform has amassed more than 2 billion downloads in more than 200 countries and 75 languages in just the past four years. And while the app has had success in diverse markets, its principles have been challenged by individuals and governments globally. In 2018, the Indonesian government enacted a one-week restriction on the app due to allegations of inappropriate content and blasphemy. The Indian government banned the app in 2020 on the grounds of geopolitical rationale. Former U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to ban TikTok due to U.S. national security concerns. Yet amidst these challenges, TikTok’s popularity continues to proliferate amongst diverse communities and influence international markets and the future development of domestic internet companies overseas."

  link: "https://dai-global-digital.com/can-regulators-keep-up-with-artificial-intelligence.html?utm_source=daidotcom"
  summary: "Artificial intelligence (AI) presents one of the most difficult challenges to traditional regulation. Three decades ago, software was programmed; today, it’s trained. AI itself is not one technology or singular development. It is a bundle of technologies whose decision-making mode is often not fully understood even by AI developers.

AI solutions can help address critical global challenges and deliver significant benefits; however, the technology could lead to unforeseeable outcomes absent clear regulations and ethical guidelines. AI can have damaging repercussions for data privacy, information, and cybersecurity, providing hackers with ways to access sensitive personal data, hijack systems, or manipulate devices connected to the Internet. Self-learning algorithms already anticipate human needs and wants, govern our newsfeeds, and drive our cars. How can we ensure that this technology benefits people widely? If AI and autonomous machines play a crucial role in our everyday lives, what sort of normative and ethical frameworks should guide their design?"

  link: "https://dai-global-digital.com/new-report-offers-guidance-to-support-agriculture-market-systems-actors-during-covid-19.html?utm_source=daidotcom"
  summary: "Digital tools and services such as short message services (SMS), digitally enabled extension services, and artificial intelligence have helped market system actors in developing countries overcome common challenges in the agriculture sector, such as accessing weather information and diagnosing pest or disease outbreaks.

Despite the documented value of these innovations, uptake of digital agriculture technology still is not widespread. A lack of affordable and accessible technologies, poor connectivity, high costs of data, and social stigmas around digital technology can be major barriers to potential users. With COVID-19 making digital connectivity critical to economic activities, development stakeholders have spent the past year and a half assessing the relationship between the pandemic and the adoption and use of digital agriculture."

  summary: "When we peel back the planning, strategy design, project management, and technical implementation layers of any creation, we see something more intuitive. More human. And that’s the desire to “create.”

Terms such as “innovation,” “research and development,” and “discovery” capture the adventure of the creative process. But garnering that same intensity in a workplace, let alone one’s personal life is not always the most accessible trail. In this post, I dive into some tools we employ as a team to foster creative innovation while also making reflections from another part of my life as a musician.

As a musician, I’ve gone through many periods of creative productivity. “Writer’s block,” as some may relate to, is the most frustrating. A quick online search generates tons of books on how to overcome creative dry spells. Meditation, exercise, and just taking a good ol’ break are some of the well-known remedies. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned from songwriting and performing, it’s that the creative process requires gentle nurturing. And just like music production, technology product development is no stranger to creative dry spells.

So, what are some of the tools we employ as a team to foster creative technology product development?"

  link: "https://dai-global-digital.com/how-digital-climate-risk-assessment-tools-can-help-unclog-climate-finance-flows-in-emerging-economies.html?utm_source=daidotcom"
  summary: "Traditional lending channels are blocking access to climate finance. The large commercial banks that receive funds from investment banks accredited by the Green Climate Fund typically seek smaller financial institutions in local markets to distribute these funds. However, these smaller institutions often lack the tools needed to appraise risk and begin lending, meaning that funds that have been allocated towards climate mitigation, resilience building, and adaptation efforts are not being efficiently disseminated."

  summary: "As most people in the international development community know, Samantha Power, former U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations under President Barack Obama, was nominated and officially sworn in as the 19th Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) on May 3.

During her confirmation hearing testimony, she acknowledged the longstanding priorities of USAID that would remain at the fore, such as women’s empowerment, food security, education, and global health, but also cited four particularly pressing and consequential global issues on which USAID would focus in the years ahead:


  
    The COVID-19 pandemic
  
  
    Climate change
  
  
    Conflict and state collapse
  
  
    Democratic backsliding
  


Thinking about these priorities and what they mean for development work in the coming years, I thought about how digital solutions fit into this picture. Though not called out specifically in her testimony, digital technologies will serve a critical role in ensuring the success and effectiveness of these efforts."

  summary: "A significant challenge to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals has been measuring country progress in the transition to renewable and clean energy sources. While expert surveys or legislation enacted may provide some insight into how countries are progressing on the whole, they lack the granularity to inform us about subnational trends, skills in-demand, and the presence of firms and subsectors within each country.

One useful way to explore these factors is by analyzing data available from job search engines and using keywords related to the energy sector. These can provide insights on how jobs in key sectors and subsectors evolve over time, what the demand for labor among firms in the energy sector is, where these openings and firms are located, and how they differ in terms of skills sought in the labor market."
