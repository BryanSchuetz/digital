  summary: "In the current climate of data collection and data harvesting by every website, company, government or official body that has access to your browser traffic, usage history, and location, your data is always at risk and vulnerable. To add to this, nothing is absolutely, unequivocally, 100 percent secure. Even air-gapped computers that have no connection to the internet, as demonstrated with the CIA-infected Iranian centrifuges with Stuxnet are vulnerable.

Did that sound alarmist? Well, it was meant to be. The good thing is there are simple measures that anyone from web and software developers to computer laypersons can take to protect themselves from the inevitable breach of their data. The more aware we are and the more precautions we take to avoid exposing our “IRL”-selves to the ever-present threats, the better our chances are of staying secure."

  summary: "This analysis is Part 6 of a series on COVID-19, with a specific focus on Mexico. The analysis will be updated as we receive additional data and the code for all related analysis will be made available shortly.

For the past two months, COVID-19 has made its way beyond the borders of the United States and into other countries of the Americas, namely the second and third largest countries of the region: Brazil and Mexico. While the United States’ daily incidence of deaths slowly declines, Mexico reported its largest daily incidence yet with 1,092 deaths on June 4."

  summary: "Dear friends and colleagues: we had a lighthearted blog post ready to go this week, but in light of recent events, we’re sure it can wait. Instead, we’re using this time to pause and reflect about the killing of George Floyd and the years of structural racism and inequities that his story represents, both in the U.S. and across the countries where DAI works. We’re also thinking about cities and communities reeling from a combination of a global pandemic and widespread unrest. In the meantime, take care and stay strong."

  summary: "Silicon chips are literally black boxes to most of us. We understand that transistors are somehow etched in tiny patterns on these silicon wafers, and that these patterns make possible the computers, phones, and other electronic devices that run our modern world. Digital solutions are built on a foundation of silicon, and the landscape of silicon chip production is changing in ways that could have far-reaching impact on how that foundation is laid, and by whom."

  summary: "As many countries struggle to manage the COVID-19 crisis, governments globally are looking to data-driven technologies to minimize cases or to help facilitate a transition out of lockdown. The technologies being claimed to protect, prevent, and track include symptom tracking apps that help us understand the disease, digital contact tracing apps that alert us to our interaction with the virus, quarantine enforcement apps that monitor people’s compliance (such as those in Hong Kong, Poland, and Kazakhstan; proposed in Russia and Egypt), and immunity certification that identify individuals who have had COVID-19.

In more developed nations such as the United Kingdom and United States, conversations around data privacy are rife. For example, the UK National Health Service (NHS) is negotiating with Google and Apple about the efficacy of its proposed contact-tracing app in light of the two tech giants’ stringent adherence to privacy.

In the face of serious threats, many of us might say we have a reasonable expectation that our government will use technology to track and pre-empt risks. In the same way we might expect protection from terrorist attacks, we may also accept such measures to be employed during a public health crisis like the current pandemic.

But the vital question is: how can we ensure that the deployment of these digital tools are effective and do not set a dangerous precedent of digital surveillance?"

  link: "https://dai-global-digital.com/covid-19-part-5-different-methods-to-model-infection-rates-in-mexico-and-what-they-tell-us.html?utm_source=daidotcom"
  summary: "The challenges of measuring the infection rates of COVID-19 are enormous for even the most prepared countries, given the need for testing to reach a significant enough amount of the population to accurately detect its spread. While the total number of recorded cases in the world thus far have mostly been in the United States, Europe, and East Asia, many low- and middle-income countries have begun to see increases in reported cases.

In Mexico, the number of cases has slowly risen. Public health experts have urgently suggested that testing needs to be dramatically increased to appropriately track the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the graph below shows, the numbers reported from Worldometer corroborate this testing deficit, as Mexico has one of the lowest rates of testing per 1 million people in the region, even among countries of similar size and income per capita."

  summary: "Less than two weeks ago, on April 21, 2020, Microsoft announced its support for the growing open data movement through the launch of an “Open Data Campaign.” Having recently spent several days researching successful open data initiatives, the statement caught my attention. The World Bank uses the Open Knowledge Foundation’s definition for open data. According to it, open data means data “can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose.” In practical terms, this means data that is both legally open, publicly accessible or with minimal restrictions, and technically open, published in electronic formats that are computer readable and nonproprietary. This type of data is not to be confused with “big data.” As I recently learned, there are differences. For instance, open data derives its value from the sharing of the data and its widespread availability, rather than the volume (as big data does). I won’t be spending more time on this particular topic, but if you’re interested in learning more, I highly recommend reading a guest post we published on the subject in 2016."

  summary: "Often in the early days of digital development, it felt like there was a small group of big, innovative brains in one room all working on similar visions of how best to leverage the growing presence of the iconic Nokia 3310 across the developing world. Frontline SMS, Ushahidi, Souktel, and other groups were leading the charge from various corners of the earth, and design luminaries such as Jan Chipchase were interviewed in New York Times think pieces on how cellphones could end global poverty. When I moved to Palestine to work for Souktel at the end of 2010, I was often in the same room as ICT4D “godparents” Ken Banks, Adele Waugaman, and Erik Hersman, pleading our case to skeptical mobile network operators and Silicon Valley types who found our little ventures thrilling in a slightly Orientalist way. With texting as the tech du jour, everyone codified similar lessons in real time around the successful design of, for example, mobile awareness campaigns. The ICT4D sector grew rapidly across markets, simultaneously building strong use cases for users and development practitioners alike. I do have some hilarious stories of mobile campaign lessons learned from the Somali piracy crisis, but I will save those for another post.

Now, all these lessons are relevant again as we globally try to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic."

  summary: "While tackling the spread of the COVID-19 disease takes a multi-faceted approach, behavior change—especially around personal and respiratory hygiene, proper handwashing, social distancing, and so on—remains a critical need across countries where DAI and our clients operate. Further, as organizations and individuals increasingly embrace digital-based approaches to collaboration, communication, and information gathering, we are presented with an opportunity to incorporate these technologies across behavior change communication strategies. However, as many organizations have experienced since the start of near-global lockdowns, this transition to an all-digital way of working comes with unique roadblocks.

Over the last few weeks, the DAI Center for Digital Acceleration has been exploring how digital communication tools can be used to build communications campaigns aimed at stemming the COVID-19 tide and spreading accurate information about targeted behaviors. We’ve pulled together some quick thoughts on the topic, but frankly, these are principles that apply in most any effort of this sort."

  summary: "Five years in Cambodia leading the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Development Innovations project taught me a lot about innovation. I saw innovators employ entrepreneurial thinking to develop out-of-the-box, creative solutions to problems, helping hundreds of thousands of Cambodians—automated phone calls warning people of coming floods comes to mind, as does a mobile test prep application to help high school students prepare for national exams. It’s this entrepreneurial thinking that the world desperately needs in this time of hardship, where livelihoods, the economy, and social cohesion are being challenged in unprecedented ways. Which naturally begs the question: In the face of COVID-19, what happens next in Cambodia’s innovation community?"

  summary: "One of the participants in the Think Global Make Local product development workshop, sponsored by our Cambodia Development Innovations project in 2016, created a design for a toy called Doy Doy. With Doy Doy’s silicone straws and plastic connectors, kids can build complex structures. The product has gone on to achieve modest commercial success locally. I found Doy Doy instructive because of the way its creator, Em Chanrithykol, ended up manufacturing the toy’s plastic connectors. Because of a lack of local injection-molding capacity and administrative barriers to importing parts made by contract manufacturers outside of Cambodia, Chanrithykol turned to a less traditional method: He contracted a local firm to churn out the parts on a battery of 3D printers.

3D printing is slow, expensive, and inefficient. It is great for small runs of one-off items or prototypes, but it is a terrible way to mass manufacture a product. But the lesson of Doy Doy is that a bad way to mass manufacture a product can still be better than having no way to mass manufacture a product. This is why I am currently manufacturing personal protective face shields for Baltimore-area hospitals in my basement."
