  summary: "Today is the United Nations’ International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. Like every year on this day–and any other official “Day” that amplifies the inequalities between women and men–I’m heaving a big sigh… because we’re still here. We still require these Days. We continue to need reminding that women are still fighting for equality all over the world.

These thoughts can get me down, but today, I’m pulling up my positive socks. Observing these Days provides an opportunity to celebrate the progress societies have made in closing gender gaps and can galvanise us to acknowledge the work still left to do. If days like today inspire us to take positive action to shape a better world for women and men, then that is all to the good.

Online Abuse and Gender Digital Divide

The internet mirrors and amplifies the social norms of the offline world, as we described in this post from 2017. Just as women and girls are more likely to be at risk of more types of violence than men and boys in the physical world, so too are they in the online world. In our previous blog post, we outlined the effects of this inequality on digital inclusion. Abuse on digital platforms, especially when there are no apparent consequences for the perpetrators, may cause victims to opt out of internet use and all the potential benefits that it affords.

Research released this year highlights that these issues still affect the behaviour of women and girls. Plan International conducted the largest-ever global survey on online violence, which showed that 58 percent of girls surveyed have experienced online harassment. One in five girls (19 percent) have left or significantly reduced their use of a social media platform after being harassed, while just over one in ten (12 percent) have changed the way they express themselves.

All participants in the DAI Center for Digital Acceleration’s recent research in India and Ghana on User Perceptions of Trust and Privacy on the Internet voiced concerns about the offline consequences of online behaviour, but the study found that those perceptions most acutely limit what women do online, potentially exacerbating the online gender gap and leaving female internet users even further behind. The Web Foundation’s Women’s Rights Online project showed that women are more concerned about their privacy online compared to men, across a range of personal data categories, including private messages, home addresses and healthcare information. The GSMA Mobile Gender Gap Report 2020 found that safety and security concerns had increased in importance as a barrier to mobile internet usage between 2018-2019. These studies all demonstrate the immediate need to address these issues now, or risk further exacerbating the gender digital divide.

Finding New Solutions

This October, as part of Cyber Security Awareness month, DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration launched its flagship Cybersecurity Frontier Insights research into user perceptions of trust and privacy on the internet. In a panel discussion, experts touched on the particular needs of women in this area and emphasized that without real-world consequences for those abusing women online, women may choose to remain offline.



Meghan Lefeber, Senior Economic and Private Capital Advisor, USAID.

“The gender digital divide is one of the really critical issues that we need to be looking at here when we’re thinking about trust and digital inclusion,” said Meghan Lefeber, Senior Economic and Private Capital Advisor at USAID. “Gender-based violence and cyber harassment online is a huge issue that will either keep women offline or will inhibit women from feeling comfortable using digital tools. We really have to tackle these issues.”



Eleanor Sarpong, Deputy Director and Policy Lead, Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI).

“If we are going to address the issues of user trust, particularly for women, we need to tackle the perceptions of the authorities; the male gatekeepers in the communities we’re working in,” said Eleanor Sarpong, Deputy Director and Policy Lead at the Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI). “We need champions–male and female–for women’s connectivity, who can help make misogynistic behaviour towards women and girls socially unacceptable. But of course, such behaviour also needs to be legally and practically unacceptable. If somebody is being trolled online and seeks redress in the offline space, they should be taken seriously and they should be able to receive it. The abusive act shouldn’t be seen as something that ‘just’ happened online–that it is somehow less serious than if it happened in person–which is so often the case. It will require some level of training of and resourcing to various legal institutions and court systems to support people who feel that they’re victims of online abuse.”



Derek Laryea, Head of Research and Communications at the Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications.

Derek Laryea, Head of Research and Communications at the Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications, added that “joint or enhanced collaboration is needed in a market to drive change, especially when trying to address the demand-side challenges users face.”

Meghan Lefeber agreed: “We need both a top-down and bottom-up approach: it needs to examine the policies and regulations that are in place and consider how we can ensure that people are held accountable for gender-based violence online. This effort should be complemented by a community approach to tackle how we address the very real, practical challenges that women and girls face when using the internet and how we change the culture around that in communities. If we don’t address gender-based violence and the challenges that women face online, the digital gender gap is only going to become a bigger obstacle down the road.”

Eliminating Violence Against Women In-Person and Online

Today marks the start of the UN’s 16 Days of Activism, in which member states are called upon to:


  
    Fund essential services to prevent gender-based violence and women’s organizations that are at the forefront;
  
  
    Respond to the needs of survivors, including during the global pandemic;
  
  
    Prevent gender-based violence from happening in the first place by challenging cultural and social norms, creating mobilization campaigns, and implementing a zero-tolerance policy; and
  
  
    Collect data to improve services, programmes, and policies.
  


These efforts are all important, but leave me asking whether such activities will acknowledge and address the online abuse of women as well as that which happens offline. Will they include better systems of redress for victims of online harassment and violence? The journey from having a policy that says people will be prosecuted for trolling online, to the community actually seeing people being prosecuted for trolling online, is a leap that must take place in many markets around the world.

As our offline and online worlds become more connected, without addressing harassment in both, we not only expose women to risk of more harm, but also restrict them from the very positive benefits that digital inclusion can bring in all areas of their lives. Beyond this Day and the following 16, if we want to close–rather than widen–the gender digital divide, ending cyber violence against women and girls must remain high up on the development community’s priority list."

  summary: "We recently spoke with Phanith Phan, the CEO of Muuve, an innovative delivery services startup in Cambodia. Muuve was one of the startups involved in the 2019 Smartscale by Seedstars accelerator, co-funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded Development Innovations project and telecommunications company Smart Axiata. This accelerator model was investor-led and focused on connecting scalable tech startups to mentors, investment advisory services, and targeted technical assistance. Muuve is one of Cambodia’s success stories in a growing digital ecosystem—even through the COVID-19 pandemic. The young team also secured investment from Cambodian venture fund, OOCTANE, a few months after finishing the accelerator in 2019. This is an excerpt from that interview."

  summary: "Cybersecurity and cyber resilience are becoming increasingly crucial considerations for countries seeking to assert sovereignty and self-determination. This desire is particularly acute in regions such as Eastern Europe, South Caucasus, and the Western Balkans, all of which face increasingly complex cyberattacks emanating from nefarious individual and nation-state actors. As these countries navigate digitalization and the interconnectedness of their critical infrastructure (CI) operations, including financial networks and government services, they must strengthen their capacity to address vulnerabilities caused by new technological developments and an increasingly hostile international security environment. Domestic leadership, regional cohesion, and international support are pivotal in strengthening cybersecurity capacity, legislative and strategic frameworks, and institutions in these regions."

  summary: "COVID-19 has caused major disruptions for people from all walks of life. It has dramatically changed the nature of activities we used to do in person, especially those aiming to bring people together to learn, exchange knowledge, and strengthen relationships. As we grapple with the uncertainty of how in-person education and training will continue as the pandemic evolves, many types of learning experiences have preemptively moved online, especially those for adults.

At the Center for Digital Acceleration, we see significant opportunities for creative digital collaboration that would have been impossible just a year ago. Electronic learning has emerged as a particularly interesting category for development solutions. Projects with goals that span the thematic spectrum—from strengthening agricultural supply chains to supporting rule of law to stemming climate change—are considering how to implement digital curricula and thinking carefully about what approaches could work best for their myriad stakeholder groups."

  summary: "The Western Balkans, like many regions across the world, is navigating the disruptive effects of COVID-19 on their economies, while also digitalizing numerous critical sectors. Critical infrastructure (CI) is defined as “the physical and cyber systems and assets that are so vital to [a country] that their incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact on physical or economic security or public health or safety.” Recent threats emanating from malicious individual and nation-state actors remind us that cybersecurity considerations are vital to mitigate potentially widespread and devastating effects. In fact, the need to focus on network and system securities is only accelerated with the unique nature of digital challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic in the region."

  summary: "Even though the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Journey to Self-Reliance has been covered extensively by the press, think tanks, academia, and implementers since its 2018 launch (more than 390,000 Google search results and counting), not much has been written about the countries that have actually graduated from assistance. Latvia—a small country of two million people wedged between Russia and the Baltic Sea—was one of 11 central, eastern, and southeastern European states to graduate in the 1990s or early 2000s. After $57 million over eight years of USAID support ending in 1999, what’s going on in Latvia now? Specifically, what’s going on in Latvia’s startup scene and in the digital realm? Quite a bit, as it turns out—from throwable microphones and localization and translation management platforms to one of the world’s first COVID-19 contact tracing apps using the Apple/Google application programming interfaces (APIs). I sat down with my friend of 25 years, Julia Gifford, Canadian-Latvian startup advocate and founder of TrueSix—a Latvian content marketing firm that helps brands get noticed in the U.S. market with strategic content, copy, and advertising—to find out more."

  summary: "Last week we shared that the Center for Digital Acceleration was launching our most recent Cybersecurity Frontier Insights research into user perceptions of trust and privacy in India and Ghana. Here are the findings from that report, which can be downloaded here.

Since the creation of the internet more than 30 years ago, our lives, economies, and societies have changed dramatically and the restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic have accelerated change even more. As we’ve developed seemingly endless new methods of online communication, commerce, and civic participation, the international development community has become more acutely aware of a growing digital divide: those who are poor, rural, remote, illiterate, female, or living with disabilities in emerging markets risk being excluded from the benefits of digital transformation. Therefore, especially in recent years and months, we’ve seen valiant efforts from governments, private companies, and the development community to bridge digital gaps aiming to enable more people to access and benefit from online services. However, as access and use has increased, so has the number of digital risks, with data breaches, fraud, surveillance, and cybercrime on the rise globally."

For those interested in reading more about the research, the report can be found here.

In this blog—the second in the series—we will dig into data protection and the potential consequences of increasing centralisation. Through an assessment of the literature and existing practice, our research team found that implications of fragmented management information systems (MIS) can be grouped into the following thematic areas: political, protection, legal and ethical, commercial, and operational. As there are numerous risks and benefits of increased centralisation of MIS (our previous blog outlined some of the arguments), we cannot possibly provide an exhaustive list here. But in this post, we will give an overview of some of the considerations, including where care needs to be taken before proceeding; where the political economy must be assessed; and where more data needs to be collected."

This spring, the COVID-19 pandemic brought travel to a halt around the world. USAID project teams hustled to determine what essential activities could be continued safely, and what would have to be put on hold.

It quickly became clear that site visits could no longer take place. So how could projects—especially those in remote areas without reliable internet connectivity—replicate the important experience of visiting a project in the field?"

You have heard their names cried out in the streets along with demands to dismantle systemic racism and you have witnessed how their untimely deaths launched a global conversation about racism, justice, and the value of black lives. For many, these three names reinvigorated a hunger for social justice and kicked off months of protesting, donating, reading, and conversing through confusion, anger, guilt, hurt, and hope. With this historic and emotional summer drawing to a close, I find myself wondering what will become of the hunger. As the shock and outrage subside, and corporate promises to “do better” ease mounting public pressure, I wonder how best to ensure this drive for social change lasts."
