  summary: "More than 30 members of North Macedonia’s government, critical infrastructure firms, and other key institutions recently completed the country’s 5th annual National Coordination Exercise and Cyber Drill.



The three-day exercise strove to diagnose the government’s current capacity for cyber incident response and identify areas for improvement. The exercise clarified roles and established national protocols within the government, improving the country’s readiness to mobilize a coordinated and effective response to a cyber crisis and protect public institutions. Findings and recommendations from the drill will be provided to the National Cyber Incident Response Team. These conclusions will inform the country’s ongoing effort to reshape its policies and institutional capabilities, addressing the country’s heightened cyber threat environment.




  “We plan to harness these expertise to fortify our cybersecurity strategies and enhance our abilities to respond to incidents,” said Ervin Regepagic, Vice President of the Agency for Electronics Communications. “This exercise helped catalyze our collaboration and knowledge exchange. Ultimately, this will elevate our resilience against evolving cyber threats.”


Activities moderated during the exercise included:


  Review of “Cyber Threats to North Macedonia: Trends and Geopolitical Factors.”
  Review of “Cyber Resilience: Current Trends in National Coordination and Response.”
  Tabletop exercise and cyberattack drill with participants mirroring roles within the national cybersecurity authority for cases of a ministry and national critical infrastructure operator under cyberattack.
  An after-action review to identify successes and vulnerabilities.


Exercise facilitators drew parallels to recent cyberattacks both globally and within North Macedonia, including the September 2022 cyberattack of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Economy, during which North Macedonia experienced disruption to the functioning of the ministry and its 40 branch offices.



The exercise was organized by the Agency for Electronic Communications of the Republic of North Macedonia and sponsored by U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) through the Critical Infrastructure Digitalization and Resilience (CIDR).

“We are committed to translating these learnings into tangible measures that strengthen our cybersecurity posture at the national level,” said Mr. Regepagic of the AEC."

  link: "https://dai-global-digital.com/some-spider-sense-to-kick-off-20-more-years-of-cybersecurity-awareness.html?utm_source=daidotcom"
  summary: "This is the fifth in a series of blog posts about cybersecurity to mark Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October. This blog first appeared in the Tech Policy Press here.

“Spiderman,” as he was dubbed, worked for military intelligence as an undercover volunteer.

As told by Nathan Thornburgh in Time, Spiderman, later identified as Shawn Carpenter—a U.S. intel contractor by day—watched by night as hackers breached networks of the U.S. military and made off with uncommon stealth. Spiderman “clung unseen to the walls of their chat rooms and servers,” following the stolen files from site to site, landing him virtually in China’s Guangdong province. When his private-sector employers found out what he was doing, they fired Carpenter and stripped him of his top-secret clearance for “inappropriate” after-hours sleuthing.

Around the same time, in October 2004, a small nonprofit called the National Cyber Security Alliance, together with the new U.S. Department of Homeland Security, proclaimed the first National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. Their message: Update your antivirus software twice a year.

Safe to say, cybersecurity awareness has come a long way since Spiderman got sacked."

  summary: "This is the third in a series of blog posts about cybersecurity to mark Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October.

For digital development practitioners, cybersecurity is now in the digital development zeitgeist. Over the past five years or so, it has become an important standalone technical area, as well as a critical building block of all our interventions. In honor of Cybersecurity Awareness Month, I wanted to revisit Digital@DAI’s earliest posts about cybersecurity from 2018 to see how our initial thinking holds up against a 2023 mindset. Our first-ever series on cybersecurity introduced the concept of cybersecurity to digital development practitioners by doing three things:


  Providing a technical explanation of cybersecurity and linking it to the concept of trust;
  Examining cybersecurity through the lens of regulations, skills, and institutions, aligned to the World Bank’s 2016 Digital Dividends report, and;
  Examining the topic of pirated software at the micro level."

  summary: "This is the second in a series of blog posts about cybersecurity to mark Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October.

The 2022 Threat Landscape Report published by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) highlights the spread of disinformation as one of the top eight cybersecurity threats. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Disinformation Primer defines disinformation as information that is shared with the intent to mislead people. As the world becomes more digitally connected and as digital technologies become more integrated into different aspects of daily life, it is important to understand the impact of digital disinformation. For example:


  Disinformation can cause people to stop trusting the institutions and systems that assist them in exercising their fundamental human rights.
  Citizens who do not trust their electoral systems will be deterred from exercising their right to vote.
  Business owners who are hesitant to use digital technologies will find it harder to earn a good income."

  summary: "This is the first in a series of blog posts about cybersecurity to mark Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a fascinating field that is taking the world by storm. It is a cutting-edge technology that allows algorithms to create new and unique data, which was unimaginable just a few years ago. While traditional AI models are designed to recognize and classify existing patterns, generative AI models are trained to generate new patterns and unique output data. With generative AI, the possibilities are endless—MidJourney and DALL-E create art, and ChatGPT writes compelling pieces of text that are nearly indistinguishable from those created by humans.

Imagine the potential of this technology in industries such as healthcare and cybersecurity, where it can be used to create new and innovative solutions to existing problems. The possibilities are truly endless, and we are only at the beginning of this exciting journey. However, despite offering exciting opportunities and applications in cybersecurity, generative AI comes with its challenges."

  summary: "(Originally published on DAI’s Developments blog.)

In 2014 and early 2015, more than 3,000 volunteers peered into their monitors to try and decipher poorly handwritten and scanned annual asset declarations from Ukrainian officials that described their properties, vehicles, land, commercial venues, bank accounts, and cash. It was a tedious task. At times, it seemed that civil servants deliberately used bad handwriting to comply with the requirements of paper-based transparency. By 2022, before the full-scale war, any internet user would have free access to more than 2.5 million asset declarations searchable through the public registry of the National Agency for Prevention of Corruption of Ukraine and at least one advanced civil society powered instrument that worked on the data-fuel from this registry. The difference was night and day. Now, instead of peering into illegible scans of handwritten scribbles, with a click of a button you can check whether a company owned by civil servant John Doe won any government contracts last year, and whether his elderly parents bought a mansion close to the capital or a new luxury car—and ask questions to the authorities.

Governments worldwide are rushing to use digital technology to reduce corruption. Over the past decade, state agencies have increasingly used digital systems to conduct anti-corruption investigations, gather and analyze asset declarations, automate electronic procurement processes, and analyze open data. Despite initial implementation difficulties in many countries, these digital tools have proven effective. Many governments that benefit from donor assistance are now asking to prioritize resources for upgrading or building new IT systems to help counter corruption."

  summary: "Editor’s Note: This post is adapted from a lightning talk presented at the recent Global Digital Development Forum (GDDF) 2023.

Over the last few years, DAI has expanded its cybersecurity portfolio to cover regions including Asia-Pacific, Eastern Europe, and the Western Balkans. Designing and delivering programs that focus on building the resilience of cybersecurity stakeholders and ecosystems involves investments in three key elements of cybersecurity: people, process, and technology. It also demands that we apply this approach with local existing conditions. Importantly, cybersecurity programming also requires flexibility for rapid responses in case of unforeseen and new threats, political turnover, or major geopolitical developments expanding cyber or hybrid warfare. This is naturally dictated by realities and conditions in the geographies where we work, where local actors and beneficiaries often face external shocks requiring adaptation.

  summary: "Globally, women are 18 percent less likely than men to own a smartphone. This statistic illustrates—particularly in low-income, rural households—the “gender digital divide,” where women are less likely to be connected to the internet and lack access to important tools that could improve their lives.

The gender digital divide limits women and girls’ opportunities on all fronts—from gaining an education to accessing their finances online to participating in politics and society.

Recognizing how digital inclusion empowers women and boosts the economies of rural communities, the USAID/Microsoft Airband Initiative has partnered with six private companies in five countries to provide women and girls with meaningful connectivity, internet access, and the skills necessary to navigate the digital world.

  summary: "This post is adapted from a lightning talk presented at the 2023 Global Digital Development Forum (GDDF).

The term digital native was coined by Mark Prensky in 2001. The writer and educator used it to broadly describe a generation that grew up in an era shaped by the internet and digital technology. Digital natives are believed to possess a mastery of technological skills that are inherently different from prior generations. Prensky referred to the arrival of the digital age as a “singularity” that caused students of the time to “think and process information fundamentally differently than their predecessors.” These skills were attributed to the early introduction of digital tools into the homes, schools, and social lives of young people and the perception that this technology is seamlessly integrated into their daily interactions."

  summary: "From our social media feeds to the societal benefits we receive, artificial intelligence (AI) is everywhere and affects everyone. AI may assist us in a variety of ways: it can execute difficult, risky, or tedious tasks on our behalf; assist us in saving lives and coping with natural disasters; entertain us; and make our daily lives more enjoyable. AI helps doctors make decisions about our health and helps judges and lawyers sift through cases, speeding up the judicial process.

Governments worldwide are increasingly turning to AI algorithms to automate or support decision-making in public services. Algorithms assist in urban planning, prioritize social-care cases, make decisions about welfare entitlements, detect unemployment fraud, or monitor people in criminal justice and law enforcement settings. The use of these algorithms is often seen to improve efficiency and lower the costs of public services."

  summary: "Sesame Workshop and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) partnered to address the critical needs of children affected by the Syrian conflict and other crises in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. The Ahlan Simsim initiative addresses the urgent needs of children affected by crisis and conflict by creating educational resources that reach children through an award-winning and impactful TV series viewed by more than 23 million children and through early childhood services that integrate media reaching more than 1 million children and caregivers in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. Ahlan Simsim is exploring the possibility of expanding its work to other countries, specifically Libya.

Over the past 18 months, DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration has been working with Sesame Workshop to explore the possibilities for using digital tools to provide education services to young children living in crisis-affected communities. Using DAI’s Frontier Insights™ methodology, in 2021 DAI conducted research in Yemen, Colombia, and South Sudan  to understand communities’ barriers to connectivity, technology usage habits, and ways to leverage those habits to improve access to educational content.

In October and November 2022, the team continued its research in Libya, focusing on three locations: Khoms (east of Tripoli), Brak al Shati (south), and Tripoli Center. The local research team conducted surveys with 64 households, focused on children ages 3–8 and their parents or caregivers. In this blog we share the findings from that research."

  summary: "The role of women in agriculture is crucial, especially in countries such as Bangladesh where they make up almost half of the sector’s labor force. However, women often have limited access to resources and assets that could improve their livelihoods, including information that can be accessed through technology.

Digital agriculture tools, such as mobile apps and texting services, can help overcome the information disparity between men and women. But first, it is essential to understand the unique challenges that women face in agriculture and how digital tools can address those challenges. Women often have limited access to land, capital, and information, which hinders their participation. Moreover, they have limited mobility, which makes it difficult for them to physically access markets and other agricultural services.

  summary: "In 2016, the Government of Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) brokered a peace accord that ended nearly five decades of internal armed conflict. After years of reconciliation and peacebuilding efforts, however, new emerging threats to civil society, while digital, have the potential to incite physical violence, according to findings in a 2020 Digital Ecosystem Country Assessment (DECA) report published by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and DAI’s Digital Frontiers project. The report recommended that USAID invest in cyber hygiene programming in Colombia to assess and improve online and offline safety. Today, USAID Colombia has partnered with USAID’s Digital APEX project to build just this type of capacity.

As more USAID Missions like Colombia’s grapple with the emerging opportunities and challenges of our digital world, the Digital Strategy is shaping the Agency’s response. To design policies and programs that take advantage of technology, stakeholders need to first understand the building blocks of a country’s digital landscape. The DECA, a cornerstone of the Digital Strategy, is helping development practitioners to do just that.
