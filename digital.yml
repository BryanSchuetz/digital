  summary: "At DAI‚Äôs Center for Digital Acceleration (CDA), we use ethnographic design research when we create digital tools to help marginalized people and institutions around the globe. Why? By working closely with those we seek to help throughout the design and development process, we:


  Define the problem in their terms, not ours;
  Learn of, and about, previous attempts to solve the problem;
  Develop our understanding of local culture and history, as well as how people seek and share information and use mobile technology so we can meet them where they are;
  Mitigate the risks inherent to spending limited resources developing software or building digital tools, given the costs of doing so;
  Build ownership of the solution among the population; and‚Ä¶
  Enlist those who participate as promoters of the solution among their personal and professional networks.

  summary: "I have a confession to make: I am a bonafide, card-carrying qualie. For those of you who aren‚Äôt familiar with this term, it‚Äôs a (nerdy) colloquialism to define people who are really into qualitative research. I swear, it‚Äôs a thing.

So yes, I am a qualie. I have been involved in conducting qualitative, ethnographic research in some way or another throughout the course of my sinuous career. I get jazzed by learning about people‚Äôs lived experiences‚Äîthe barriers they encounter when attempting to improve their health and well being; the things that make changing behavior a snap; all of it. Throw some neuroscience in there to understand what‚Äôs happening in the brain and the ways in which emotional responses catalyze behavior change? Yes. Yes, please. I am in heaven."

  summary: "üì± Smartphone connections continue to rise and people, globally, love to game. The Global Systems for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) estimates that by 2025 78 percent of all developing market mobile connections will be smart. By that time GSMA predicts that India will be the second-largest smartphone market by adoption globally (ahead of the United States), with 1 billion smartphone connections. Interestingly, India is already among the top five mobile gaming countries globally, expected to surge to 368 million gamers in 2022. If this is a bellwether for developing markets, we can expect gaming to be a significant force across the global south."

  summary: "This post marks the launch of a Digital Identity series here on Digital@DAI. It is a pivotal topic to many of our technical areas: from health service provision, to cash transfers, and voter registration. It is also a topic garnering increased attention with the debate over privacy and data security‚Äîand the global refugee crisis reinforcing the opinion that there is ‚Äúno single factor that affects a person‚Äôs ability to share in the gains of global development as much as having an official identity.‚Äù

Over the next few months, we will look at some of the issues and opportunities around Digital ID in the development space. Today, we look at informed consent: what it means to the development sector, the difficulty of getting it, and what we can do to make sure we aren‚Äôt leaving people behind, while respecting their privacy and the security of their data."

  summary: "Technologists and developers love to talk about the best tools for building new technology. MERN or MEAN stack, functional vs. object-oriented programming, vanilla development or frameworks. The internet is ripe with these discussions and attend any tech meetup and you‚Äôll easily find multiple discussions comparing one tool to another. The performance and usability of one over the other, as if that is the goal."

  summary: "They say to write about what you know. For the first part of my career and through my formal education, my work was all based in the world of water and sanitation. Glamorous stuff‚Äîpipes and pumps, fecal coli-forms and treatment options, toilets and activated sludge. It made for great dinner conversation (or so says my wife). At some point, I made the transition from a water guy who worked with a lot of data to a data scientist who knows about water. And as I dive deeper into the analogies and lingo of modern data systems and tools, I lean on my engineering training to make sense of it all."

  summary: "Rapidly changing access to digital tools such as basic mobile phones is changing the landscape for how we can address the challenges to ending global hunger, undernutrition, and extreme poverty. ‚ÄúDespite our collective progress in global food security and nutrition over recent years, a projected 702 million people still live in extreme poverty; nearly 800 million people around the world are chronically undernourished; and 159 million children under five are stunted. Food security is not just an economic and humanitarian issue; it is also a matter of security, as growing concentrations of poverty and hunger leave countries and communities vulnerable to increased instability, conflict, and violence.‚Äù (U.S. Government Global Food Security Strategy 2017-2021)."

  link: "https://dai-global-digital.com/machine-learning-changes-the-business-case-for-automated-phishing-attacks.html?utm_source=daidotcom"
  summary: "Researchers have demonstrated the capability of machine learning to help with everything from saving honeybees and tracking flu vaccine uptake, to aiding in the fight against bioterrorism, and plenty in between.

But machine learning can also be put to less-scrupulous uses just as easily. Social engineering is a type of cyber attack that deceives users into creating security breaches, typically through emails and phone calls (often called ‚Äòphishing‚Äô), and the marriage of machine learning with social engineering is poised to be a burgeoning issue in the near future. This issue is a global problem, but developing markets are often at the highest risk for cyberattacks due to the lack of capacity to defend against and track such attacks. As such, they often find themselves as the testing grounds for novel attack methods before they reach more developed markets."

  summary: "One of the attractions of awarding prizes in global development is that the prize sponsor shifts the responsibility of achieving results onto competitors. While this approach can inspire a range of creative solutions and spur a nascent market, it also means many finalists will develop something valuable whether they win the award or not. For a prize to be valuable to both sponsors and competitors, sponsors must clearly communicate prize objectives so that competitors have the best chance at success and can assess whether devoting resources to achieve those objectives makes sense for them, win or lose."

  summary: "We in the international development community talk a lot about privacy and security in digital development. We try to think through privacy and security in terms of the data we collect, what we do with it, and even how we address issues of consent around data collection. There‚Äôs an entire digital principle about it.

In discussions like these, privacy and security are framed entirely in terms of the paradigm of extraction‚Äîcollecting and gathering data from end users to organizations. This is an entirely valid and important discussion to continue having. However, there‚Äôs a discussion we‚Äôre not having that‚Äôs arguably even more important, and that‚Äôs around the privacy and security of users."

  summary: "In our quest to increase digital access, we tend to focus on the dividends, rather than the negatives that can arise. We are understandably excited about edging closer to universal access and the new business opportunities and improvements to service provision that accompany it. But while we are improving in our endeavor to promote online safety and security, bridge the gender digital divide, and include people with disabilities (all great stuff!), we could be overlooking some negative consequences of increased digital access."

  link: "https://dai-global-digital.com/digital-tools-against-illegal-mining-and-logging-in-the-amazon.html?utm_source=daidotcom"
  summary: "A recent report prepared by the Amazonian Geo-referenced Socio-Environmental Information Network (RAISG) and InfoAmazonia, in coordination with eight other Latin American institutions, published a map that shows more than 2,000 data points across the Amazon where illegal activity is occurring. This includes illegal mining and logging in 96 protected areas. Most of the illegal activity is taking place in Venezuela where there are a reported 1,899 data points documenting illegal mining or logging. Venezuela is followed by Brazil where 321 cases of illegal activity are recorded. In Ecuador, the number drops to 68, and in Peru, 24. For organizations, governments, or advocates looking to protect the Amazon, this digital tool seems like a blessing. Yet, based on my experience it‚Äôs unclear whether these information-streamlining tools are actually limiting illegal activity."

  summary: "On January 5, I posted the message below on Facebook to hold myself accountable to my New Year‚Äôs resolution.



It‚Äôs simple. I want tech businesses to grow and thrive in Nigeria outside of Lagos. I want to support someone who grew up in, works in, and wants to continue working in my hometown, Uyo. This is not just my resolution, but has been my life‚Äôs work since I started Start Innovation Hub five years ago. Start Innovation Hub is an ICT firm and innovation lab that works to expand the tech industry by supporting tech startups and talented individuals in Uyo. We build skills and connect entrepreneurs to economic opportunities, as well as support local businesses by developing software solutions. You can‚Äôt deny that the tech sector in Nigeria is growing rapidly, but the concentration of firms in Lagos means that places like Uyo are left behind. Through Start Innovation Hub, I hope to change that."

  summary: "Technology and data are converging in ways that allow monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) professionals to more effectively monitor, evaluate, learn, and adapt on their projects. Dashboards are one of the key tools contributing to this trend, having become more accessible and user friendly through platforms such as Microsoft PowerBI.

Dashboards are an information management tool that visually track, analyze, and display metrics and data points to monitor the status of a project. DAI is creating dashboards for all new projects to enable teams to learn, evaluate, and adapt to project realities in near real-time. Ultimately, these dashboards make for better monitoring and evaluation and‚Äîin turn‚Äîbetter projects. Therefore, it‚Äôs important to get it right. So where should you start?"
