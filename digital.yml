  summary: "Sesame Workshop and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) partnered to address the critical needs of children affected by the Syrian conflict and other crises in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. The Ahlan Simsim initiative addresses the urgent needs of children affected by crisis and conflict by creating educational resources that reach children through an award-winning and impactful TV series viewed by more than 23 million children and through early childhood services that integrate media reaching more than 1 million children and caregivers in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. Ahlan Simsim is exploring the possibility of expanding its work to other countries, specifically Libya.

Over the past 18 months, DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration has been working with Sesame Workshop to explore the possibilities for using digital tools to provide education services to young children living in crisis-affected communities. Using DAI’s Frontier Insights™ methodology, in 2021 DAI conducted research in Yemen, Colombia, and South Sudan  to understand communities’ barriers to connectivity, technology usage habits, and ways to leverage those habits to improve access to educational content.

In October and November 2022, the team continued its research in Libya, focusing on three locations: Khoms (east of Tripoli), Brak al Shati (south), and Tripoli Center. The local research team conducted surveys with 64 households, focused on children ages 3–8 and their parents or caregivers. In this blog we share the findings from that research."

  summary: "There is no doubt that Sesame Street has produced an immense amount of educational media content for children. The iconic video of the Count von Count muppet teaching children how to count to ten permeates through American society. This value has expanded beyond the United States, providing globally accessible videos to numerous countries. Most recently, in 2022, Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind Sesame Street, created a library of newly produced, modular, play-based, and globally relevant animation videos called Watch, Play, Learn (WPL) to be distributed in humanitarian contexts and beyond. The 140 segments are five minutes each and cover thematic early childhood development areas: science, math, social-emotional learning, and health, safety, and child protection."

  link: "https://dai-global-digital.com/lessons-learned-in-bangladesh-engaging-women-in-digital-agriculture-tools.html?utm_source=daidotcom"
  summary: "The role of women in agriculture is crucial, especially in countries such as Bangladesh where they make up almost half of the sector’s labor force. However, women often have limited access to resources and assets that could improve their livelihoods, including information that can be accessed through technology.

Digital agriculture tools, such as mobile apps and texting services, can help overcome the information disparity between men and women. But first, it is essential to understand the unique challenges that women face in agriculture and how digital tools can address those challenges. Women often have limited access to land, capital, and information, which hinders their participation. Moreover, they have limited mobility, which makes it difficult for them to physically access markets and other agricultural services.

  summary: "In 2016, the Government of Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) brokered a peace accord that ended nearly five decades of internal armed conflict. After years of reconciliation and peacebuilding efforts, however, new emerging threats to civil society, while digital, have the potential to incite physical violence, according to findings in a 2020 Digital Ecosystem Country Assessment (DECA) report published by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and DAI’s Digital Frontiers project. The report recommended that USAID invest in cyber hygiene programming in Colombia to assess and improve online and offline safety. Today, USAID Colombia has partnered with USAID’s Digital APEX project to build just this type of capacity.

As more USAID Missions like Colombia’s grapple with the emerging opportunities and challenges of our digital world, the Digital Strategy is shaping the Agency’s response. To design policies and programs that take advantage of technology, stakeholders need to first understand the building blocks of a country’s digital landscape. The DECA, a cornerstone of the Digital Strategy, is helping development practitioners to do just that.

  summary: "This post originally appeared on the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ website.

Rapid advances in technology are transforming every industry in the global economy. In particular, the disruption created by the COVID-19 pandemic pushed governments, companies, and citizens to adopt a wide range of digital solutions. Many activities—including government services, work, schooling, and retail—shifted online. The pandemic also revealed that workers and regular citizens were not equipped with the right skills to operate in the digital age. A study conducted by the European Commission in 2021 revealed that only 54 percent of Europeans possess basic digital skills. In 2022, Salesforce’s new Digital Skills Index found that three out of four workers globally did not feel ready to operate in a digital-first world. Most worrisome is the fact that the same study revealed only 28 percent of respondents were actively engaged in training programs or pursuing learning opportunities to acquire digital skills.

  summary: "Transmitting data through transparent fibers barely thicker than a human hair, the Africa Coast to Europe (ACE) optical-fiber submarine cable system revolutionized Liberia’s information and communications technology (ICT) sector. Landing off the shore of Liberia’s capital, Monrovia, in 2011, this 17,000-kilometer cable that stretches from France to South Africa marked the country’s introduction to high-speed internet. Providing connectivity to 24 countries, the cable also demonstrated a commitment to reduce the digital divide and democratize internet access in Africa through secure, diverse, and resilient ICT infrastructure investments.

While ACE, made possible through a landmark agreement between a consortium of telecommunications companies and member countries, significantly increased connectivity in Monrovia, the lack of optical fiber cables beyond the capital resulted in low connectivity in Liberia’s rural areas. Moreover, Liberia lacks a much-needed system of high-speed networks linked together with fiber-optic connections to establish what is formally known as a fiber backbone—a critical prerequisite to fully maximize the ACE cable’s potential."

  summary: "UPDATE: The full report is now available for download here.

Digitalization presents both opportunities and challenges for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in emerging markets. Digital tools can increase business efficiency and reach, but also increase exposure to misinformation, fraud, and cyber attacks. Such “digital downsides” can lead to financial losses, reputational damage, loss of customer trust, and other challenges that hinder MSMEs’ ability—and desire—to participate in the digital economy. In this post, we’re previewing a soon-to-be-released report that DAI authored about the economic impact of misinformation and other digital harms on MSMEs in Kenya, India, and Cambodia.

As part of our research, and with the help of our in-country local partners, we asked 85 business owners about their understanding and awareness of misinformation and other digital downsides and the impact of these experiences on their businesses. We further wanted to understand the types of digital tools (social media platforms, messaging services, digital payment devices, etc.) that business owners in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs) use and what gaps exist that could be filled through training or by government, private sector, nonprofit and other actors. Lastly, we uncovered how misinformation factors into a business context, rather than an electoral or public health context (which is how misinformation has typically been studied)."

  summary: "This post originally appeared on the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ website.

Technological advancements are transforming every sector of the global economy, opening the way for governments, businesses, and individuals to drastically reframe how they engage with one another. The field of international development is not immune to these changes and has, in fact, seen a marked shift in new approaches and business models in response to today’s digital age. Development practitioners are actively responding to the increased role of tools like artificial intelligence, digital identity, digital financial services, and geospatial visualization in project design and implementation. However, the increased use of digital technology also carries real risks to users. Beyond cybersecurity and data privacy breaches, the rise in disinformation and misinformation, the increased risk of misuse, bias, and discrimination, and the growing trend of digital authoritarianism around the world are all causes for concern."

  summary: "As we do annually, it is time for the Top 10 Posts of 2022. What a year! A bit of a return to normalcy after the hardships of 2021, with a welcome return to childcare (not joking), in-person meetings, and travel to connect with colleagues and do technical work globally. In the digital development world, a continued reckoning with the complex challenges of advanced technologies and the multitude of benefits—and risks—of widespread digital transformation.

Happily, it seems our predictions for what we’re thinking about in 2022 were largely correct. Through Digital@DAI, we covered topics as varied as ethical artificial intelligence (AI) and its importance in international development, a robust series on digital literacy, and the disability divide in ICT. Interestingly, the top two most-read posts published in 2022 were climate tech-focused. Climate tech has been called the “new frontier for innovation and growth” and investments in the sector are at an all-time high. Our readers’ engagement with these posts aligns with the expanding focus on this area in digital development."

  pub: "Digital"
  date: 2022-12-14
  link: "https://dai-global-digital.com/chatbots-for-the-international-development-and-humanitarian-sectors-what-works.html?utm_source=daidotcom"
  summary: "You may have noticed chatbots becoming more commonplace in your life. Buying yourself a new sound system online? A chatbot pops up offering help. Need to confirm flight details? The airline’s chatbot can do that for you. Chatbots can offer a quick and easy way to get the information you need on the platform you are already using, whether that be a website, Facebook Messenger, or WhatsApp.

As they operate with low bandwidth and are simple to use, chatbots seem like they could be a beneficial technology to engage with recipients of our development and humanitarian programs, don’t they?

As with any technology, the use of chatbots is migrating from the private sector and becoming more prevalent in crisis and conflict response. However, documentation of lessons learned, successes and failures, and best practices of the use of chatbots in the development and humanitarian sectors are still few and far between. Through our work with Sesame Workshop, DAI conducted desk research and key informant interviews to examine use cases and review lessons learned for the use of chatbots in the international development and humanitarian sectors. In this blog, we summarize our key findings.

  summary: "A couple of months ago, my family was visiting me in Rwanda. We were traveling two hours outside of the capital, in a rural, forested area, on what seemed to be the only straight patch of road in the mountainous country. As we were admiring the landscape, in my rearview mirror, I saw a flash. I knew she got me. Sophia—one of Rwanda’s notorious traffic cameras (jokingly called “Sophia” by Rwandans and named after a humanoid robot that spoke at the Transform Africa Summit in 2019) cruelly captured me going over the speed limit. Within 15 minutes, I received a speeding ticket via text message. I quickly paid the fine through Rwanda’s mobile money app, MoMo, and we continued our trip. Despite the ticket, I had to marvel at the technology that underpinned the entire exchange."

  summary: "Recently, I’ve been thinking about how the organizational shifts at Twitter will affect TikTok. With Tesla CEO Elon Musk now owning one of the world’s most high-profile information systems, there are bound to be changes in user satisfaction. While TikTok and Twitter have different features and purposes, a few questions have popped up for me. Will we see more users flocking to TikTok due to Musk’s acquisition (or vice versa)? Will TikTok’s brand, ownership, or features change to compete with Twitter’s upcoming changes? Will communities find new ways to organize and communicate beyond both apps? Is it a matter of time before a more unique, more innovative platform rides the wave (and hopefully, betters all of our attention spans)?

While I don’t have the answers to any of these questions, I do have the answer to one question: Is TikTok really that influential?"

I also offered tips and tricks to avoid falling victim to headlining, like taking a moment to pause and ask yourself, “Does this sound too good or too awful to be true?” and actually reading a news article before you share it. Now I want to take headlining and situate it directly in the contexts and communities in which international development practitioners work.

  summary: "Originally published on the McKinsey &amp; Company website.

Artificial intelligence (AI) could have a significant impact on individuals, businesses, and governments. Here is what countries need to know about its benefits—and the first steps toward realizing them.

The long-term potential of AI to change key aspects of the way we live and to support the operations of businesses, governments, and other organizations is hard to grasp.

Indeed, AI has contributed to improvements in quality of life for all segments of society through innovations such as predictive healthcare, adaptive education, and optimized crisis response. The National Health Service in the United Kingdom, for instance, set up a National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database containing a shared library of chest X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images to support the testing and development of AI technologies to treat COVID-19 and a variety of other health conditions. Businesses have seen increased productivity and operational efficiency using autonomous robotics in manufacturing, AI-optimized supply chains, and intelligent cargo routing with autonomous vehicles, among other initiatives. For example, many logistics companies are using AI-powered sorting robots to optimize their warehouse operations. Governments can also harness the power of AI through personalized services and automated processes. Consider Singapore’s “Ask Jamie,” a virtual assistant that helps citizens and businesses navigate government services across roughly 70 government agencies through AI-powered chat and voice."

  link: "https://dai-global-digital.com/digital-at-dai-rewind-is-intellectual-property-ready-for-blockchain.html?utm_source=daidotcom"
  summary: "If you’re an avid reader of the Digital@DAI blog, then by now you’ve surely heard of blockchain technology. For those in need of a refresher, blockchain is a decentralized database system that records information in a way that makes it near-to-impossible to change, breach, or cheat the system. International donors and the private sector have deployed blockchain towards furthering financial inclusion, digital government, and improved supply chain management.

More recently, governments and the private sector are exploring how this technology can be applied toward the building of secure and data-preserving e-governance systems. Governments across the globe, such as in Chile, Estonia, Singapore, Uzbekistan, and Venezuela, to name a few, are using blockchain and other emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and smart contracts to build digital governance systems. An exciting feature of blockchain is that it can support the creative industry by serving as intellectual property rights register and enforcement tool. For instance, the European Union Intellectual Property (IP) Office, in collaboration with participating offices, launched a Blockchain IP register, which has the ability to automatically store data about registered IP rights in various IP offices.

As blockchain is a versatile technology that impacts many sectors from cryptocurrency to creative industries and IP management, it is crucial that the digital development sector stays abreast of blockchain’s impact on digital transformation. This week, we will revisit a post from 2021 from Dr. Miriam Stankovich about blockchain’s applicability to patents, copyrights, trademarks, and industrial designs."

  summary: "The “Right to Repair” is a concept and advocacy movement centered around the idea that anyone who owns a device, machinery, or piece of equipment should have the right to repair it themselves or take it to a repair person or shop of their choosing. While this has been a subject in tech news for the last several years, the concept is back in the spotlight. Last week, Apple unveiled its new, more repairable iPhone 14 and in June, the New York state legislature passed the United States’ first Right to Repair bill. With the movement picking up steam, we are reminded that there are linkages to our work in digital development. This week, we will revisit a 2021 post from Rob Ryan-Silva, Director of DAI’s Maker Lab, about why this movement is an issue the development community needs to care about."

  summary: "Originally published on the ICTworks blog.

When the war in Ukraine comes to an end (hopefully with Ukraine having recovered all of its territories, including Crimea), Western countries are likely to provide a massive aid package to help rebuild Ukrainian infrastructure, buildings, and lives. This moment in history will offer an opportunity for Ukraine to engage in rapid digital transformation. We should already begin deploying digital tools that will help Ukraine as it continues to fight bravely against the invaders, with the intention of seeing the country emerge from war on the right foot for a quick recovery. As President Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself said the post-war reconstruction should use the moment to build “a new foundation for our lives: … accessible new technologies, best practices, new institutions and, of course, reforms.”"

  summary: "Due to the rapid rate of digitalization catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic, cyber-attacks have become ubiquitous, presenting opportunities to improve cybersecurity practices for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). SMEs contribute up to 40 percent of the gross domestic product in emerging economies, make up 90 percent of all businesses, and provide more than 50 percent of employment worldwide, making them significant economic drivers and digital supply chain actors. They also endure unprecedented malicious cyber activity, such as ransomware, phishing, password targeting, and advanced persistent threat attacks. In Nigeria, cyber attacks against SMEs have increased by 89 percent, in 2022 alone, and in India, more than 60 percent of all SMEs experienced attacks last year."
