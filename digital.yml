  summary: "Widespread digitalization has revolutionized almost every industry, including music and sound production. While rarely the focus of digital development initiatives, creative entrepreneurs like artists and musicians in emerging economies have also found themselves scrambling to adapt to the ever-changing technology and social media landscapes. As such, this year, with funding from USAID’s Digital Asia Accelerator (DAA) initiative and as a part of the Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership, The Sound Initiative (TSI) – a vocational program for musicians – launched their “Music 4.0” program to support Cambodian entrepreneurs striving to excel in this dynamical industry.

  summary: "Digital tools and services such as short message services (SMS), digitally enabled extension services, and artificial intelligence have helped market system actors in developing countries overcome common challenges in the agriculture sector, such as accessing weather information and diagnosing pest or disease outbreaks.

Despite the documented value of these innovations, uptake of digital agriculture technology still is not widespread. A lack of affordable and accessible technologies, poor connectivity, high costs of data, and social stigmas around digital technology can be major barriers to potential users. With COVID-19 making digital connectivity critical to economic activities, development stakeholders have spent the past year and a half assessing the relationship between the pandemic and the adoption and use of digital agriculture.

Constructing a Rapid Analysis

To support market system actors as they navigate the opportunities and challenges of digital transformation amidst COVID-19, the U.S Agency for International Development (USAID) Bureau for Resilience and Food Security employed the DAI-managed Digital Frontiers project to commission a rapid analysis. The analysis aimed to understand the impacts of digital tools among agricultural market system actors concerning COVID-19. The analysis focused on three key objectives:


  Identifying and analyzing the trends driving the adoption of digital tools in agriculture market systems in response to the global pandemic.
  Providing examples of such digital solutions across market system actors.
  Providing concrete and actionable recommendations for USAID missions and implementing partners to ensure that digital tools can be used effectively to increase resilience in the face of future threats.


The research team focused on eight countries: Bangladesh, Ghana, Guatemala, Kenya, Malawi, Nepal, Niger, and Senegal. Findings demonstrated that market actors increased their use of digital solutions as a result of the pandemic, while digital service providers moved quickly to launch and adapt their existing services to meet the evolving needs of their customers. Researchers also observed that the rapid onset of the pandemic led market system actors to reach for familiar tools or services already available to continue operations. Very few market actors adopted “newly” launched digital solutions in direct response to COVID-19. (The full research findings are discussed in more depth here and in the report itself.)

From Research to Action

The research team developed a group of supplemental guidance documents to help donors and implementing partners support agriculture market actors respond to shocks like COVID-19 and beyond. The documents focus on three digitally enabled solutions—E-commerce Marketplaces, Farmer Management Solutions, and Expanding Mobile Phone Access and Ownership— and highlight how these solutions work, how they’ve been used in different contexts, and how they can be assessed and introduced. While I strongly recommend exploring these guidance documents for helpful tips, I summarized a few of the standard checklist items below. I hope they are helpful for those in the process of supporting market system actors through the ever-changing landscape that COVID-19 has introduced.

Assess the Landscape: Before introducing any new digital solution, it is critical first to conduct a landscape or market assessment to determine if it is the right fit for your target population. Determine the size of the potential customer base, whether there is demand for such a solution, what similar solutions are already available in the marketplace, any potential supply- and demand-side constraints, and relevant user information such as the degree to which they already use digital tools, their literacy levels, and barriers to access.

Test and Engage: Do not be afraid to test out promising solutions identified during your assessment. The guidance recommends that for publicly accessible services like e-commerce platforms, implementers and donors should set up accounts to log in and explore the platform’s functionality. Pay special attention to the type and quantity of items sold, user-friendliness, and branding. Chances are, if you find a platform challenging or confusing to use, so will others. Reach out to the digital service provider to identify opportunities for collaboration and ask questions.

Prepare for Partnerships: Strategic partnerships are an essential part of bringing digital solutions to scale. Some partnerships institutions—such as banks, mobile network operators, and wholesale mobile phone vendors—operate outside of the development world—which can help provide users with digital devices at more affordable costs. Securing such partnerships and making them sustainable requires preparation. Be prepared to discuss the potential market opportunities that further engagement would bring and anticipate the partner’s expectations and risks. Do not forget to provide data, reports, or business case studies to convey how said risks have and can be mitigated.

Consult Your Stakeholders: When considering introducing a new solution, organize stakeholder meetings with key influencers such as farmer groups, agribusinesses, buyers, implementing partners, digital service providers, key digital experts, donors, and other private sector members. Organizing these meetings ensures knowledge collaboration and can help gather consensus around the digital solution’s viability. Stakeholder meetings can serve as opportunities to pause and reflect. If stakeholder consultations deem the tool unsuitable, there is no shame in pursuing other digital or non-digital avenues! However, if the solution is ideal, stakeholder meetings offer a space to discuss the next steps for digital service providers, users, and other potential partners.

Take Action and Provide Support: If an appropriate digital solution is identified—great! The market system actors your activity is targeting should already be aware of the solution if they attended the stakeholder consultations. If they expressed interest in pursuing it further, there are plenty of ways to provide support to ensure that they can sustainably benefit from the solution long after your project has ceased. Options include providing capacity-building support to users or service providers, and developing action plans, conducting risk assessments, running cost analyses, and offering training.

Share What You’ve Learned: Last but not least, share your findings! Let your colleagues, counterparts, and fellow digital development professionals know how the solution is working and any measurable outcomes. Capturing outcomes—such as an increase in income or improvements in quality or quantity of produce sold—all contribute to the evidence base for digital agricultural solutions to help funders determine scalable or investment-worthy solutions. If, and when, we face another massive global disruption like COVID-19, knowing which digital solutions lead to measurable outcomes can help make agricultural market systems around the world more resilient."

  summary: "When we peel back the planning, strategy design, project management, and technical implementation layers of any creation, we see something more intuitive. More human. And that’s the desire to “create.”

Terms such as “innovation,” “research and development,” and “discovery” capture the adventure of the creative process. But garnering that same intensity in a workplace, let alone one’s personal life is not always the most accessible trail. In this post, I dive into some tools we employ as a team to foster creative innovation while also making reflections from another part of my life as a musician.

As a musician, I’ve gone through many periods of creative productivity. “Writer’s block,” as some may relate to, is the most frustrating. A quick online search generates tons of books on how to overcome creative dry spells. Meditation, exercise, and just taking a good ol’ break are some of the well-known remedies. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned from songwriting and performing, it’s that the creative process requires gentle nurturing. And just like music production, technology product development is no stranger to creative dry spells.

So, what are some of the tools we employ as a team to foster creative technology product development?"

  summary: "Traditional lending channels are blocking access to climate finance. The large commercial banks that receive funds from investment banks accredited by the Green Climate Fund typically seek smaller financial institutions in local markets to distribute these funds. However, these smaller institutions often lack the tools needed to appraise risk and begin lending, meaning that funds that have been allocated towards climate mitigation, resilience building, and adaptation efforts are not being efficiently disseminated."

  summary: "As most people in the international development community know, Samantha Power, former U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations under President Barack Obama, was nominated and officially sworn in as the 19th Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) on May 3.

During her confirmation hearing testimony, she acknowledged the longstanding priorities of USAID that would remain at the fore, such as women’s empowerment, food security, education, and global health, but also cited four particularly pressing and consequential global issues on which USAID would focus in the years ahead:


  
    The COVID-19 pandemic
  
  
    Climate change
  
  
    Conflict and state collapse
  
  
    Democratic backsliding
  


Thinking about these priorities and what they mean for development work in the coming years, I thought about how digital solutions fit into this picture. Though not called out specifically in her testimony, digital technologies will serve a critical role in ensuring the success and effectiveness of these efforts."

  summary: "A significant challenge to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals has been measuring country progress in the transition to renewable and clean energy sources. While expert surveys or legislation enacted may provide some insight into how countries are progressing on the whole, they lack the granularity to inform us about subnational trends, skills in-demand, and the presence of firms and subsectors within each country.

One useful way to explore these factors is by analyzing data available from job search engines and using keywords related to the energy sector. These can provide insights on how jobs in key sectors and subsectors evolve over time, what the demand for labor among firms in the energy sector is, where these openings and firms are located, and how they differ in terms of skills sought in the labor market."

  summary: "Before joining DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration (CDA), I worked in the software development industry. For the majority of my 15 years in this field, I only worked for tech companies whose main business model was building software. To successfully build software, there are multiple practices and skills that companies need. These skills are, for example, agile methodologies and good coding practices (such as patterns and documentation) that often vary from company to company and the type of technology used. Other practices include daily meetings and specialized resources for each phase of the software development process. In addition, there are roles such as back-end developers, front-end developers, DevOps, scrum masters, graphic designers, UX designers, and more! From this, you can see there is a lot that goes into making even a small web application. But, what I have just described is the experience of working on very large teams that only make software, which is very different from work within CDA’s Products team."
