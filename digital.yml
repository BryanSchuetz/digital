  summary: "As a product development team, we spend a lot of time listening to the needs of users, particularly when it comes to their desire to collect and analyze data. And while projects have unique needs, they often ask for a common set of technology solutions. These include the ability to:


  
    Collect and manage data, often offline or online as necessary.
  
  
    Learn as much as they can from their data, often through a series a dashboards or reports.
  
  
    Upload products and share learnings with a public audience.
  
  
    Maintain an internal system for data sharing, so that people only have access to certain information.
  


Most importantly, these tools should be easy to use, and ideally not too expensive to build or maintain.

All of these are reasonable requests. If prioritized, organizations should be able to develop and maintain highly functional data management and analysis solutions. So why do so many organizations struggle to maintain these kinds of systems?
In this article, I’d like to outline two very different routes that organizations can take when trying to build out their systems: 1) completely proprietary solutions v. 2) open source technologies.

Group A: Buy It

You’ve made the decision to buy the toolkit of your dreams. Maybe you purchased licenses to mobile data collection tools that run offline on both Android and iOS devices, and paid to have that data cleaned and migrated to a knowledge management system inside of Salesforce. Sure, Salesforce has built in dashboards, but you’re hoping to learn as much as you can from your data, so you’ve purchase Tableau licenses for your staff, and an ArcGIS license for your spatial analyst. And because you want to host your results online and share them with people, you’ve purchased a copy of Tableau Server.

Pros


  
    You’ve just exponentially upped your potential data management game.
  
  
    You can build beautiful dashboards without having to keep a team of developers on staff.
  
  
    If something breaks, you can rely on one of your vendors to investigate the problem.
  
  
    Project management continues to be a priority over technology management.
  


Cons


  
    You just spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on technology, and now you and your staff need to learn how to use it.
  
  
    While you paid for licenses fees for your current staff, you may need to buy more if your organization grows.
  
  
    Even if software is easy to use, it still requires maintenance, and you may now need to hire people just to manage these tools.
  
  
    With proprietary software, often what you see is what you get. While customizable, you’ll have to wait for the next software update to add that dual axis line chart to your report.
  
  
    It’s possible that your data is in a system that only really talks to itself, and you don’t have a lot of control over how to get it out later.
  
  
    If your project comes to an end, you can’t hand over aspects of the system without finding funding for annual licenses fees.

Group B: Build it

You’ve made the decision to build your own or leverage open source tools as much as possible. To get started, you’ve installed Open Data Kit (ODK) on cloud servers, and are running PostgreSQL with a series of Python scripts to move data around. The ODK graphs aren’t very sophisticated, so you’ve decided to build your dashboards in a couple of different ways. Maybe you have a web developer on staff who is ready to learn D3, or you’ve learned or hired some R developers who can build you dashboards in Shiny. Instead of ArcGIS, you’ve made use of QGIS for spatial analysis and cartographic design. You have several servers running to host your dashboards, and are working your way through Apache, NGINX, and OAuth, trying to get your dashboards shared discreetly across your users.

Pros


  
    You’ve just exponentially upped your potential data management game.
  
  
    You’re not paying license fees and can give people access to your system without paying for additional users.
  
  
    You’ve hired seasoned analysts and developers to build your system, so your data analysis and reporting dashboards are put together by people trained in research methods and quantitative analysis.
  
  
    You’ve learned an absolute ton about technology, and there are no limitations to what your team can have assuming you have enough time to work on it.
  


Cons


  
    You’ve just spent months of your life looking at documentation.
  
  
    Every time something goes wrong, you and your team need to figure out how to fix it.
  
  
    You’ve become reliant on a whole series of dependent packages, which leaves you at risk for system failure if someone creates a package update without your knowledge.
  
  
    Technology keeps changing, so you often spend the weekend learning how to build something in a new way.
  
  
    You are now in a world where you manage technology as much as you manage your projects.
  


Reflections

As we can see from these two case studies, both Group A and Group B have come a long way on their data management journey, and each group is going to experience different challenges along the way. It’s hard to say who spent more money, as the Buy It group spent both time and lots of money on their software, while the Built It group had to hire some analysts and developers, each of whom spent quite a bit of time setting their systems up.

Our Approach

As a team, we’ve chosen to live somewhere between these two worlds, with a strong leaning towards the Build It camp. We do our best to leverage open source tools as much as possible, and when it makes sense, we have a team of developers who work in common web development framework (Python/Django). The proliferation of powerful business intelligence solutions means that we do use proprietary software, but when given the time we build dashboards in JavaScript, or by using the amazing R/Shiny framework.

What we know is this – in data management, no matter how you approach the problem set, you’re either going to have to spend time and money on professional data management staff, or spend money on software. There’s no such thing as a free lunch."

  summary: "Any ID—whether state-issued or purpose-made for services such as cash transfers—in some way reflects levels of equality, whether these are inherent in the technology or prevalent in the social ecosystem. For instance, research from the GSM Association (GSMA) in Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Rwanda showed that citizens feel that equality in national ID is important as it reflects equality in citizenship status for men and women. If a biometric-based ID card is created in a refugee camp to facilitate cash transfers, every person living in that camp can rightfully expect to be registered regardless of age, gender, or ethnicity.

We list a number of ways in which bias can manifest in digital identities to kick off some discussion and move toward solutions. While reading this, I encourage you to think how we can make sure digital ID systems are inclusive."

Maybe uploading it to a faraway server or sharing it with local partners…or stashing it away on your laptop or external hard drive. But no one else was ever able to use it. And you were sort of irritated that you had to ask a million people for the same data every time you started a new development project in a different country."

  summary: "Since 2016, Digital@DAI has kept its readers updated on the latest from the Kosmos Innovation Center (KIC) in Ghana, from young entrepreneurs’ agritech product concepts to international awards it has received. In the three years since the KIC’s launch, funders of all sorts—from bilateral donors to corporate social investors—have embraced the potential of Africa’s growing startup ecosystem to support socio-economic development and create new solutions to some of the continent’s most persistent challenges. In that time, KIC and DAI have learned a lot about what it means to support youth-led technology entrepreneurship.

We’ve compiled our findings in the latest CDA Insights paper titled, ‘Building the Future of Tech-Enabled Agriculture.’ In addition to providing lessons for both funders and implementers in this sector, we created profiles of select KIC entrepreneurs and captured their journeys."

Durante más de un siglo, la roya ha representado una seria amenaza para la industria cafetalera mundial, especialmente en la era del cambio climático. No obstante, la toma de acciones eficaces y de forma coordinada entre los países centroamericanos productores de café ha sido una tarea difícil de lograr. En consecuencia, esta enfermedad ha continuado propagándose y sus efectos han sido devastadores. Entre 2012 y 2013, la roya ocasionó que la región centroamericana experimentara una reducción del 15 por ciento de su producción de café, lo que incluyó un alarmante 31 por ciento en Honduras. El gráfico siguiente muestra las pérdidas que experimentó cada país durante este período."

Coffee rust has menaced the global coffee industry for more than a century, but particularly in the era of climate change. Nevertheless, effective, coordinated action between coffee producing countries across Central America has remained elusive, and as a result the disease has spread—to devastating effect. In 2012 and 2013, coffee rust reduced the region’s coffee production by 15 percent, including a staggering 31 percent in Honduras. The figure below shows the losses each country suffered during that season."

  link: "https://dai-global-digital.com/you-keep-using-that-word-why-scale-doesnt-mean-what-you-think-it-means.html?utm_source=daidotcom"
  summary: "The Merriam-Webster Dictionary offers seven definitions of “scale,” involving variously weight, fish, climbing, maps, music, and—unexpectedly—lumber. Notably, none of these meanings is a synonym for “to embiggen,” the usage favored in the tech and development worlds. In these environments, which share little else, taking something “to scale” always seems to evoke Carl Sagan-esque notions of quantity. What this reductionist approach to vocabulary loses (in addition to small stiff plates that cover much of the body of some animals) is the range that makes this word truly useful. In English, if not in Silicon Valley, you can scale up, but you can also scale down."

  summary: "Digital technology has revolutionized the world by providing instant access to information, finance, and networks—all of which are necessary for women to reach their full economic potential and create more self-reliant communities.

Today, 1.7 billion women in low- and middle-income countries still do not own mobile phones. The internet user gender gap is greater than 40 percent in some countries. The persistent gender digital divide is reinforcing—and even exacerbating—existing socioeconomic gaps between men and women.

Advancing women’s digital connectivity is key to promoting their empowerment in an increasingly digital world."

  summary: "Geographic information systems (GIS) are often misunderstood, or unknown to many. Even in the development community, we often have a shallow understanding of the technology once we delve into methodologies or use cases—particularly with satellite imagery, or more aptly, remotely sensed data. GIS and remote sensing are not synonymous, but scientifically and inextricably linked. When choosing a GIS/remote sensing methodology or technical analysis component for a project, it is important to understand the strengths and shortcomings of the available tools.

And rightly so, in our opinion. HCD’s focus on empathy and creativity helps us design better, more sustainable solutions to some of the most difficult development challenges. We won’t go into too much detail on the broader HCD process or its application in digital development; my colleagues have written extensively on the excellent design work they’ve facilitated in places like Cambodia, Nepal, and Guatemala. What we’d like to do today, rather, is tell you about the time we almost perished while shadowing rangers in the forests of the Philippines, and what we learned in the process.

  Define the problem in their terms, not ours;
  Learn of, and about, previous attempts to solve the problem;
  Develop our understanding of local culture and history, as well as how people seek and share information and use mobile technology so we can meet them where they are;
  Mitigate the risks inherent to spending limited resources developing software or building digital tools, given the costs of doing so;
  Build ownership of the solution among the population; and…
  Enlist those who participate as promoters of the solution among their personal and professional networks.

I get jazzed by learning about people’s lived experiences—the barriers they encounter when attempting to improve their health and well being; the things that make changing behavior a snap; all of it. Throw some neuroscience in there to understand what’s happening in the brain and the ways in which emotional responses catalyze behavior change? Yes. Yes, please. I am in heaven."
