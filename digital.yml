  summary: "Identifying and defining digital literacy can be challenging for even the most seasoned of digital development practitioners. “My previous work was very much related to digital literacy, but I didn’t recognize it as such,” shared Erica Bustinza, Project Director for the Digital Strategy Activity under the Digital Frontiers Project, which supports the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Digital Strategy implementation.

“After thinking about my previous work further, I would say over 50 percent of our team’s time and the project budget were focused on digital literacy efforts. Despite this, and my years of experience in digital development, I hadn’t ever considered that this was a ‘digital literacy’ project,” Bustinza reflected during the recent “What is Digital Literacy Anyway?” panel at the Global Digital Development Forum (GDDF).

Oftentimes, digital development programming necessitates the digital literacy of target populations, leading many initiatives to intertwine digital literacy activities with other technical programming to bring their overall objectives to fruition. Recognition of the breadth and depth of digital literacy efforts is crucial to advancing digital development worldwide."

  summary: "Digital Frontiers’ South Asia Regional Digital Initiative (SARDI) recently conducted a scoping study to explore barriers facing women in technology in South Asia, particularly those who are looking to scale and grow their businesses and engage on a regional level. A total of 47 in-depth interviews conducted in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka revealed a lack of mentorship and support for women entrepreneurs in tech. Interviewees mentioned a strong startup support ecosystem that fades away and leaves businesses lacking mentorship for growth over time and further investment opportunities. In addition, businesses lack the support required to navigate the myriad of digital policies that affect their business operations.

SARDI seeks to address these barriers through an initiative to connect women entrepreneurs in tech across the region and provide mentorship and capacity-building support to women seeking to expand their businesses. Digital Frontiers has released a request for applications (RFA) to develop this regional network and capacity-building program. As a result of this activity, women entrepreneurs’ digital capabilities will be strengthened, they will have a larger footprint in the digital economy, and an improved ability to engage in digital policy."

  summary: "A notification pops up on a business’s computer and says they have several days to pay an amount before all their data is deleted. This business just became a victim of ransomware—a debilitating cyberattack that can shut down entire companies and result in enormous financial losses. How do we protect businesses from experiencing these forms of attacks? DAI’s South Asia Regional Digital Initiative (SARDI), in partnership with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Indo-Pacific Office, recently hosted a thought-provoking webinar on strengthening the cybersecurity awareness, preparedness, and defense capabilities of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in South Asia. These businesses not only provide substantial employment opportunities in their communities but also contribute enormously to the region’s GDP levels. We felt it was necessary to bring together renowned experts from some of India’s most well-known technology firms as well as India’s Ministry of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises to address the region’s pressing cybersecurity risks, solutions, and resources. This webinar was part of the SARDI Dialogue Series of webinars highlighting the opportunities and challenges for South Asia’s MSMEs. SARDI is an activity under DAI’s Digital Frontiers project and part of the Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership (DCCP).

  summary: "We’ve all seen sensational headlines. Whether you find them through Twitter or via a WhatsApp group, headlines such as, “How Scientists got Climate Change So Wrong” (yes, that is a real opinion piece published in 2019 by The New York Times), are designed to provoke a strong emotional reaction in the reader and leave them with a false impression of reality. And while sensationalism in journalism is not new, the ongoing infodemic combined with declining perceptions of trust in news media and the cementing of social media users into echo chambers, creates a perfect storm in which headlining perpetuates misinformation. In this first of a two-part series, I’ll define the phenomenon, explain how headlining differs from “fake news,” and discuss five ways to spot and not fall victim to headlining."

  summary: "Have you ever suffered the consequences of someone else’s online gaming habits? Maybe it was your college roommate playing World of Warcraft mere hours before your 8am exam, your partner choosing Call of Duty over date night, or your child’s “hidden” Candy Crush play under the dinner table as you tried to ask about their day. It is not unheard of for frequent gaming to negatively affect one’s ability to focus, productivity at work, or social relationships. In fact, in 2018, the World Health Organization even recognized “gaming disorder” among the addictive disorders included in its 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases. Disorders are classified when the associated pattern of behavior results in significant distress or impairment in “personal, family, social, educational, or occupational functioning.”"

  link: "https://dai-global-digital.com/funding-to-develop-solutions-and-address-gender-inequitable-outcomes-from-ai-technology.html?utm_source=daidotcom"
  summary: "As the use of artificial intelligence (AI) proliferates, more instances of the inequitable design, use, and impact of AI-enabled tools in developing countries are coming to light. Many of these tools and approaches have the capacity for inequitable outcomes across genders due to humans unconsciously embedding bias in AI technology during data collection, model design or end-use applications. As a result, these tools often pose the greatest risk of harm and missed opportunities to those already marginalized in low- and middle-income countries. To foster an equitable and inclusive digital ecosystem, more efforts are needed to identify innovative and creative approaches to help decision-makers address actual and potential gender biases and inequitable outcomes resulting from AI technology."

  summary: "As we approach the second year mark of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world continues to reflect on the stark realities the crisis has forced us all to acknowledge, including key drivers of economic resilience for individual businesses. As countries take steps toward economic stabilization, it is clear that micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs)—which account for two-thirds of employment globally and between 80 and 90 percent of employment in low-income countries—play an essential role in strengthening pandemic recovery efforts. The pandemic has also revealed the vital role digital technologies play in enabling businesses, communities, and individuals to connect, function, and thrive. Ensuring that MSMEs can access digital tools is particularly crucial in emerging markets because MSMEs fuel economic growth and spur job creation."

  summary: "It is an understatement to say that data are often imperfect. There are often holes, missing pieces that always seem to be precisely the required piece to cement the foundation of your carefully crafted research question. The process of massaging that research question will not be covered here, but data exploration is pivotal in discovering what is available and what is applicable, especially so when it comes to the spatial components of datasets. Hopefully, the following information will help you in the future when looking for data or deciding which spatial data to use to augment or drive your research."

  summary: "One of the wonders of the digital age is that if at 11 pm I suddenly crave a pizza (Hawaiian preferably—no shame!), all I have to do is click a few buttons on my phone, and voila! pizza is delivered to my door. While it may feel like the pizza arrived by magic, especially given the “no-contact” options made available since the start of COVID-19, the satisfaction of my late-night craving is made possible by the work of independent contractors hired by digital platforms such as Uber and DoorDash to deliver products in cities around the world."

  summary: "As the number of digitally enabled agricultural products and services continues to grow in regions across the globe, most of the data collected by the digital service providers developing these tools remain locked within each entity’s systems. Due to incomplete, fragmented, or non-existent data sets on agri-food system stakeholders, such as farmers, digital service providers often take on the cost burden of collecting the information they need to develop products and services for their target users. This results in multiple actors holding fragments of information on agri-food system actors, decreasing incentives for data sharing across organizations and increasing the burden placed on food system actors to repeatedly provide their data to numerous researchers, companies, and development organizations. This dynamic has led to several missed opportunities for all stakeholders, including government agencies, the private sector, and the development community, to have a common and complete picture of the state of agricultural communities and the needs of individual actors therein."

  summary: "When predicting which technologies might have an impact on international development in the coming years, shifts in the economics of a technology are often more indicative of impending transformation than improvements in its capabilities. Particularly in emerging markets, even older technologies can suddenly become disruptive once their cost drops, enabling wider application. With that lens in our spyglass as we scan the horizon for coming opportunities, then, we should not forget to look up, because satellites are getting radically cheaper.

  summary: "Like much of the developing world, Costa Rica has limited availability of digital technologies compared to industrialized nations. Due to this lag in digital transformation, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, commerce in Costa Rica was highly affected, leading to business disruption and unemployment. As of June, the country’s unemployment rate was 17.4 percent, which is an improvement upon the initial losses in 2020, however, still higher than the average for high-income countries (6.4 percent).

As COVID-19 stretches into its second year, formal companies, both big and small, are jumping into the digital world to find efficient and safe ways to offer their services and products online. Informal businesses are following suit, using online platforms to reach customers.

  summary: "Over the last 25 years, Bangalore, India, has transformed itself from a relatively sleepy second-tier city into a regional anchor for global technology corporations and a hub for innovative technology-driven startups. The international development community has cheered the growth of similar hubs in low- and middle-income countries—think Nairobi’s Silicon Savannah or Lagos. But Bangalore’s story often obscures the massive environmental and social toll that rapid, tech-driven growth can have on a city."

In this second installment, we dive a bit deeper into what agile is in practice by highlighting some of the most common frameworks used by agile teams. This primer on agile frameworks and methods will by no means be comprehensive (there are entire courses, websites, and certifications dedicated to each), but it can serve as a good starting point for better understanding which flavor of agile might be best suited to your teams’ needs if you are considering adopting agile in your organization. This post will cover two of the most popular types of agile in more depth: Scrum and Kanban. There are several others that are widely used as well, but these two have many components that can be flexible and adaptable for use in non-software development contexts."

  summary: "TikTok—the popular short video-sharing app—is now the fastest-growing social media platform on the internet. Rivaling companies such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Netflix, the controversial platform has amassed more than 2 billion downloads in more than 200 countries and 75 languages in just the past four years. And while the app has had success in diverse markets, its principles have been challenged by individuals and governments globally. In 2018, the Indonesian government enacted a one-week restriction on the app due to allegations of inappropriate content and blasphemy. The Indian government banned the app in 2020 on the grounds of geopolitical rationale. Former U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to ban TikTok due to U.S. national security concerns. Yet amidst these challenges, TikTok’s popularity continues to proliferate amongst diverse communities and influence international markets and the future development of domestic internet companies overseas."
