Trevor comes from an eclectic professional background that saw the convergence of technology, electro-mechanical engineering, software development, data analytics, and musical performance. Prior to joining DAI, he worked to significantly advance quantitative methodology in conflict analytics at the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations, maintained complex automatic train control systems for a major public transit organization, and performed spatial analysis in conjunction with near real time remote sensing of deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon. Complex systems with highly specific and challenging problem sets continue to drive him on his path to solve problems. He earned his master’s degree in Geographic Information Systems and two BA’s in Psychology and Music Performance from the University of Maryland: College Park.
