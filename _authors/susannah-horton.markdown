Susannah Horton is a Senior Manager at DAI.

She has since broadened her interest beyond the education sector and gained experiences doing work at the intersection of research, data, and program implementation at the Brookings Institution and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. Susannah has spent time working in India and conducting research in the Philippines while earning her master’s degree in international development and economics from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.
