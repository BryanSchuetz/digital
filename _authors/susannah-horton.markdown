Susannah Horton is an Associate Digital Specialist at DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration. Prior to joining DAI she worked at the World Bank on a clean tech entrepreneurship program where she focused on building a sustainable monitoring and evaluation digital platform. Susannah’s interest in both international development and digital development started when she was a teacher in rural China, where she used MP3 players to increase learning outcomes. She has since broadened her interest beyond the education sector and gained experiences doing work at the intersection of research, data, and program implementation at the Brookings Institution and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. Susannah has spent time working in India and conducting research in the Philippines while earning her M.A. in International Development and Economics from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). She has a B.A. from Vassar College in International Relations.
