Rachel Clad found her way to DAI after years of field-based public health research and program implementation in the United States and sub-Saharan Africa. As Project Lead for Peripheral Vision International in Uganda, Rachel used digital insights to drive strategy for a health advocacy campaign for Planned Parenthood Global. She has worked with the Centers for Disease Control in Namibia conducting health systems analyses and on disease surveillance and quality improvement projects in South Africa and India. She has extensive experience conducting qualitative research in the United States, where she explored drivers of HIV risk behaviors and the impact of long-term discrimination on health outcomes. 

In Rachel’s role as a Global Practice Specialist in DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration, she identifies, researches, and designs global digital development solutions and conducts business acquisition activities. Rachel is passionate about human-centered design and strives to integrate its processes into more traditional development approaches. In her free time, she manages Healthcare Experience Design, a meetup group that brings together health professionals and designers for co-creation and learning events. 

She has a master's degree in health behavior from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a bachelor's degree in psychology from Georgetown University.
