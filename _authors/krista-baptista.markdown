From her early research in cultural anthropology to subsequent work in management consulting, Krista Baptista has always been engaged around ways to do things better and empower entrepreneurs to use new skills and tools. Combining this background with an interest in international development led her to DAI and, specifically, to ways that information and communication technology (ICT) and geospatial tools can be integrated into development work.
