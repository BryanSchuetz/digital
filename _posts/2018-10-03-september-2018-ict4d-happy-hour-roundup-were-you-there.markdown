Happy hours are the sinew of the ICT4D community: They are how we connect. For a few hours each month, we put aside the titles, affiliations, competition, and enjoy each other’s company over a few drinks. 

September was a particularly busy month on the ICT4D happy hour calendar, so let’s take a quick look back on what happened. Hopefully, you’ll join us for the next one! 

## ICT4Drinks

**What’s the general concept?** ICT4Drinks is the Facebook of the Washington, D.C., ICT4D community; everyone’s there! [TechChange’s](https://www.techchange.org/) Nick Martin and Chris Neu play host, greeting at the door and passing out drink tickets over the din of a crowd that generally reaches 100+. ICT4Drinks is the place to find out who’s hiring, who’s funding what and why, and what’s coming next in ICT4D. 

**What was this one about?** TechChange and DAI co-hosted the September event, which focused on next generation development professionals, as per the [recent research](https://www.devex.com/news/what-it-will-take-to-be-a-next-generation-development-professional-92764) by DAI, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and Devex on the same subject. 

**Who was there?** A broad cross section of folks representing implementers, donors, ICT4D specialists, aspiring ICT4D professionals, students, and this all-star crew:

## Technology for Democracy (Tech4Dem)

**What’s the general concept?** Tech4Dem is a bi-monthly gathering of technologists who work with governments, activists, businesses, and multilaterals to improve the quality of representative government around the world. It’s a more niche audience than the ICT4Drinks crew, and is centered around a brief technical presentation from an expert, as well as a brief Q&A. 

**What was this one about?** Tech4Dem hosted Julio Herrera, the Director of [Red Ciudadana](http://redciudadana.org/) (Human Network), a Guatemalan nonprofit that uses open data and web apps to engage the public around critical issues of governance, transparency, and accountability.

**Who was there?** Tech4Dem is popular with the [National Endowment for Democracy](https://www.ned.org/) organizations, which include the [National Democratic Institute](https://www.ndi.org/), the [International Republican Institute](https://www.iri.org/) (both co-sponsors), the [Center for International Private Enterprise](https://www.cipe.org/), the [Center for International Media Assistance](https://www.cima.ned.org/), as well as [IREX](https://www.irex.org/) and DAI (the other two sponsoring organizations). Beyond that, a wide range of free press and good governance-oriented organizations, consultants, and experts are regulars.

## Human-Centered Design for Development (HCD4D)

**What’s the general concept?** HCD4D is the newest ICT4D happy hour. It’s run by a group of designers and aims to elevate the practice of human-centered design in the international development space. The founders believe that for technology to facilitate impact, it must be well-designed, and that good design hinges on a deep understanding of how a specific population uses technology, sees itself, and sees its social context. The happy hour is focused on sharing best practices and elevating the discussion about design among global development implementers. 

**What was this one about?** The inaugural event was a discussion of the distinctions between designing for domestic or commercial clients and designing for international development programs. 

**Who was there?** [Souktel](http://www.souktel.org/), [Creative Associates](https://www.creativeassociatesinternational.com/), [Dalberg](https://www.dalberg.com/), [Forum One](https://forumone.com/), IREX, DAI, as well as designers from a variety of tech companies and government agencies.
