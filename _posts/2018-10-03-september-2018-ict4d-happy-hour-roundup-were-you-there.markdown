Happy hours are the sinew of the ICT4D community: they’re how we connect. For a few hours each month, we put aside the titles, the affiliations, the competition, and enjoy each other’s company and a few drinks. 

September was a particularly busy month on the ICT4D happy hour calendar, so let’s take a quick look back on what happened; Hopefully you’ll join us for the next one! 

## ICT4Drinks

**What’s the general concept?** Imagine Facebook, but instead of everyone meeting in a virtual space when it’s convenient for them, everyone meets in a physical space at the same time! (Strange concept—I know—but stick with me.) That’s ICT4Drinks for the DC ICT4D community; everyone’s there! TechChange’s Nick Martin and Chris Neu play host, greeting at the door and passing out drink tickets over the din of a crowd that generally reaches 100+. ICT4Drinks is the place to find out who’s hiring, who’s funding what and why, and what’s coming next. It’s also the place to let it be known that the latest ICT4D buzz concept is obviously [horse puckey](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=horse-puckey); why implementer Y shouldn’t have won that grant (and why you should have); and what the tea leaves say about donor X’s funding priorities next year.

**What was this one about?** TechChange and DAI co-hosted the September event, which focused on next generation development professionals, as per the [recent article by Devex](https://www.devex.com/news/what-it-will-take-to-be-a-next-generation-development-professional-92764) on the same subject. 

**Who was there?** A broad cross section of people representing implementers, donors, ICT4D Specialists, aspiring ICT4D professionals, students, and this all-star crew:

## Technology for Democracy (tech4dem)

**What’s the general concept?** Technology for Democracy is a bi-monthly gathering of technologists who are working with governments, activists, businesses, and multilaterals to improve the quality of representative government around the world. It’s a more niche audience, as compared to the ICT4Drinks crew, and is centered around a brief technical presentation from an expert, as well as a brief Q&A. 
**What was this one about?** tech4dem hosted Julio Herrera, the Director of [Red Ciudadana](http://redciudadana.org/) (Human Network), a Guatemalan non-profit that uses open data and web apps to engage the public around critical issues of governance, transparency and accountability.

**Who was there?** Technology for Democracy is popular with the National Endowment for Democracy organizations, which include the National Democratic Institute, the International Republican Institute (both sponsors), the Center for International Private Enterprise, the Center for International Media Assistance, as well as IREX and DAI (the other two sponsoring organizations), as well as a wide range of free press and good governance-oriented organizations, consultants, and experts.

## Human-Centered Design for Development (HCD4D)

**What’s the general concept?** HCD4D is the newest of DC’s ICT4D happy hours. It’s run by a group of designers and aims to elevate the practice of human-centered design in the international development space. The founders believe that good design hinges on a deep understanding of how a specific population uses technology, sees itself, and sees its social context, and the happy hour is focused on learning and best practices. 

**What was this one about?** The inaugural event was a discussion of what the distinctions are between designing for domestic or commercial clients, and designing for international development programs. 

**Who was there?** Souktel, Creative Associates, Dalberg Associates, IREX, DAI, as well as designers from a variety of local tech companies and government agencies.
