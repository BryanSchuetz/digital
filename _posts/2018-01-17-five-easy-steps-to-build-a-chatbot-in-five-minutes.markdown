Last year I wrote a blog post called [I Made a Facebook Chatbot (And You Can, Too)](https://dai-global-digital.com/facebook-chatbot.html). Therein I laid out the case for chatbots as an outreach and engagement tool in international development. To recap, that case boils down to:
1. [1.3 billion active users](https://venturebeat.com/2017/09/14/facebook-messenger-passes-1-3-billion-monthly-active-users/), including a large and growing number of whom are in developing countries, as DAI's [Digital Insights](https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=digital-insights) work has highlighted.
2. Low data usage puts the tool (and services riding on it) in a category of communication that's even cheaper than SMS in many instances, especially when users are connected to WiFi
3. Natural language and conversation may be easier for some people than a web interface (to take it a step further, this might be an argument in favor of IVR). 

I also featured [Siti](https://www.messenger.com/t/1276881939061378), a very simple Facebook Messenger chatbot bot I built using [Chatfuel](http://www.chatfuel.com), and gave a broad description of how I went about making it. Since then I've upgraded my chatbot skills from Apprentice to Wizard, and I'm eager to share 


am eager to show others how easy it can be to build a Facebook Messenger-ready chatbot.
