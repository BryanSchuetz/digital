Last year I wrote a blog post called [I Made a Facebook Chatbot (And You Can, Too)](https://dai-global-digital.com/facebook-chatbot.html). Therein I laid out the case for chatbots in international development:
> 1.3 billion users](https://venturebeat.com/2017/09/14/facebook-messenger-passes-1-3-billion-monthly-active-users/) and low data charges
> Featured [Siti](https://www.messenger.com/t/1276881939061378), a very simple Facebook Messenger chatbot bot I built using [Chatfuel](http://www.chatfuel.com), and gave a general description of the steps that went into building it. Since then I've upgraded my chatbot skills from Apprentice to Wizard, and am eager to show others how easy it can be to build a Facebook Messenger-ready chatbot.
