#SATDiversity and #FatData are two hashtags I did not expect to see blaring across the screen when I attended the SatSummit conference this week. These bold declarations were something new; a compression of expression, capturing with perfect brevity the major themes of a fledgling tech space on the cusp of bringing real change almost as quickly as the terabytes of data that rain down to Earth from satellites bearing the names of these space-technology pioneers.
#SatDiversity

Diversity is emerging in the tech space and it’s following the tried and true form of innovation that is almost directly from the Clayton’s Christensen’s Innovator’s Dilemma, in which he states that 

> Generally, disruptive technologies underperform established products in mainstream markets. But they have other features that a few fringe (and generally new) customers value. Products based on disruptive technologies are typically cheaper, simpler, smaller, and, frequently, more convenient to use – Clayton Christensen
