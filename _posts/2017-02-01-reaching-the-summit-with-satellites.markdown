# Thematic Hashtags
#SaTDiversity and #FatData are two hashtags I did not expect to see blaring across the screen when I attended the [SatSummit ](https://satsummit.io) conference this week. These bold declarations were something new; a compression of expression, capturing with perfect brevity the major themes of a fledgling tech space on the cusp of bringing real change almost as quickly as the terabytes of data that rain down to Earth from satellites bearing the names of these space-technology pioneers.
#SatDiversity

Diversity in product offerings is indeed taking shape in remote sensing and it’s following the tried and true form of innovation precisely as Clayton’s Christensen describes it in his seminal business strategy book, *The Innovator’s Dilemma*:

> Generally, disruptive technologies underperform established products in mainstream markets. But they have other features that a few fringe (and generally new) customers value. Products based on disruptive technologies are typically cheaper, simpler, smaller, and, frequently, more convenient to use – Clayton Christensen

Essentially, the big incumbent company forges a path and then smaller, cheaper products emerge to fill niche consumer segments. 

# Incumbency in Remote Sensing
The quote is strikingly similar to the strategy pursued by Planet Labs and Astro Digital. It is as if the CEOs read Clayton Christensen and the next day decided to make disruptive remote sensing companies. In this scenario, Digital Globe is the successful incumbent, launching just recently a top-of-the-line satellite called WorldView 4 estimated to cost over $600 milion . It is the Lexus of commercial satellite platforms with multispectral images at sub-meter (31cm panchromatic images) resolution. This is the highest quality commercial grade imagery you can get. It is expensive to acquire because the high resolution imagery is so much more then pretty pictures. The multi-spectral part lets users to do amazing things like monitor specifically the crop health of a plantation, a critical tool for establishing alerts related to food security and other natural resources.

# Sources of Disruption
Planet Labs and Astro Digital are the small-sat companies playing the role of disruptors. They focus on a segment of customers, one that requires good imagery of an area on regular basis and they do so at a fraction of the cost of the high-end providers.  The imagery produced by small sat companies is by all measures of less quality than Digital Globe’s. The resolution is lower at 3-5 meters and it is without the multi-spectral bands that let you monitor vegetation quality, heat, dryness and all matter of other things. But here’s the thing. You can do a lot with 3 meter imagery, especially when it covers the entire globe a few times per day. Cargo ships for example are wider and longer than 3 meters so if you need to monitor the movement of ships in a port then Planet Labs might be the best option.

But this incumbent being disrupted by an upstart innovator is actually an old story and incumbents have learned how to do small scale innovation (see Amazon and Alphabet). Don't count out Digital Globe, this is by no means the story of the begnning of the end of a corporate giant. Instead we will see new products from DG that are innovative derivatives of their existing product line
 


# #FatData

#FatData was another theme presented by Bronwin Agrios, making a subtle distinction from big data in that the smallest unit of data in remote sensing, say a 30 meter resolution image with its metadata is still big and we need great services to process these images. That is AstroDigital’s angle, relieving the user to download data and instead create a suite of APIs to help developers build things with code without necessarily needing to create their own fat data stores.
