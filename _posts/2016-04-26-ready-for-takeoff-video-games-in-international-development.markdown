## From Gaming to Development Impact 

I was 6 when my dad brought home our first computer. It was an IBM 386. At the time, it was space-age technology. By today’s standards it’s the musical equivalent of banging two rocks together. I imagine my dad expected my older brother and me to learn the interface and how to type. Instead, within weeks we were mowing down Nazis in [Wolfenstein 3D](https://static.3drealms.com/media/screenshots/c7185590cf634773b4d56490e26aec1e.jpg) and engineering some pretty spectacular crashes in in [Stunts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CITIXlw_T4). Needless to say, I was hooked.

Over time, the fearful prospect of a broken computer (and no video games) drove me to sit with my older brother and learn how to troubleshoot software problems, stamp out viruses, and perform open heart surgery on the thing. These skills would come in handy in high school when I took a side job fixing computers, and a few years later as a Peace Corps volunteer in the Dominican Republic, where I spent weekends moto-taxi’ing around the country helping fellow technology education volunteers turn rooms filled with large, beige paperweights into working computer labs. Four years after leaving Peace Corps technology remains an integral part of my life and work; At DAI it’s my job to find ways to make our projects focused on governance, economic growth, and climate change adaptation more efficient and more effective by incorporating new technologies. For me, the role is a culmination of my experience working with technology, starting with video games. 

These days, young people’s path from video gaming to social impact is hardly so circuitous. Today’s “games for good” challenge racism, teach life skills, combat violent extremism, and instill civic values. This newfound focus on behavioral change in gaming is attracting attention in the international development sphere, where [multiple](http://technologysalon.org/how-we-can-leverage-online-games-for-social-impact/) [events](https://ict.demcloud.org/civicrm/event/info?id=10) have popped up recently around the potential for using [video games](https://www.facebook.com/events/1719065978318415/) to engage with young people in developing countries. 

But why now? Educational video games have been popular for years (Mathblasters, anyone?), but only recently has the ground been so fallow for gaming as a tool for in the international sphere. So what gives? In a word: mobiles.  

## Gaming in the Developing World

The fact that [75 percent of people globally now have access to a mobile phone](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2012/07/17/mobile-phone-access-reaches-three-quarters-planets-population) (a number predicted to [grow to 90 percent by 2020](http://www.ericsson.com/news/1872291)) means that it’s no longer a surprise to find a young woman in a rural area of a developing country—far beyond the nearest internet connection—playing Banana Kong on her phone. 

Anecdotally, during my [recent research trip to Honduras](dai-global-digital.com/consumer%20insights/2016/04/13/honduras-consumer-insights.html), I found that 71 percent of the youth in interviewed had a smartphone, and 60 percent used their phones to play games. 

Many play the latest games, such as Clash of Clans, Candy Crush, and Piano Tiles, which they either download, or--for those in rural areas--get from their friends via via Bluetooth. Contrast this to Indonesia, where 48% of the youth we interviewed played mobile games.

While learning to swipe two dimensional candies from left to right is not the type of behavioral change that we in the international development community seek to promote in-and-of-itself, gaming as a hobby does present opportunities to present engaging tools for attitudinal and behavioral change for youth.

## Games for Good

[Games for Change](http://www.gamesforchange.org/) is an organization that promotes games with a social mission. Its online catalogue is filled with excellent examples of games being used to challenge assumptions, change perceptions, and affect positive social behavior. A few examples: 

* [Stereowiped](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id972396140?mt=8) aims to challenge stereotypes about social, ethnic, and minority groups; 
* [Endgame Syria](http://gamethenews.net/index.php/endgame-syria/) is a news-based strategy game that challenges players to think seriously about which decisions might inflame the country’s civil war and which might bring peace a step closer; 
* [The Migrant Trail](http://theundocumented.com/) forces players into the shoes of either a border guard or undocumented immigrant, attempting to enter the United States. 

Elsewhere, NDI’s Meron Menwyelet describes her experience [developing a new game for civic engagement](https://www.nditech.org/games4democracy) in Nigeria and USIP’s Derek Caelin takes on [games for peace building](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/08/can-your-playstation-stop-a-war-videogames-peace/). 

## Wrapping it All Up

Looking at what’s already being done in the field of games for good, it’s easy to see international development organizations investing more in designing mobile-accessible games for future projects, particularly if pre-existing platforms and game engines can be re-purposed economically. Globally, with mobile phones in the hands of so many marginalized people, the opportunity to reach them in a way that resonates is simply too ripe to ignore. 

Have you seen gaming applied well in an international development setting? I’d love to hear about any strong examples in the comment section or on Twitter @DAIGlobal with the #DigitalDAI hashtag.
