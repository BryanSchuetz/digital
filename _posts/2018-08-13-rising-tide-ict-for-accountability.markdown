A tectonic shift is taking place in commerce, and we’re all a part of it. At its core, it boils down to one concept: accountability. The accelerating movement toward web-based management tools, data analytics, and automation among businesses—coupled with the rapid growth in mobile phone technology—has reduced the cost of doing business, slashed barriers to entry, and reduced the time elapsed from concept to market-ready solution. The result is increased competition, more customer choice, greater accountability to the customer, and the delicate touch of the sledgehammer falling upon formerly protected industries. Customers in the many B2C verticals ([admittedly not all](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2018/08/13/middle-class/?hpid=hp_no-name_opinion-card-f-2%3Ahomepage%2Fstory)) have more bargaining power than ever before, and can hold businesses accountable for poor performance with a few simple by downloading a competitor’s solution with a few simple clicks in the app store.

## Facebook: Too Big for Accountability?

Take Facebook, for example, the leader in social media, boasting nearly 2 billion users. In July, the company saw nearly a [fifth of its value](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/why-facebook-inc-stock-dropped-112percent-in-july/ar-BBLHLym) evaporate in a single day, in the wake of a quarterly report detailing a 50% increase in operating expenses; a major hit to profitability. Is Facebook’s market position secure enough—and are their competitors distant enough in the rearview mirror—that they can afford to go full Wolf of Wall Street?

Of course not! Like any business, Facebook balances competing priorities with scarce resources; such massive voluntary cost increases represent a huge dent in the company’s bottom line and increased risk of a now-realized investor backlash. So what’s going on? On the heels of a hit parade of data-related scandals, the company has now significantly upped their investment in user privacy and security. If Mark Zuckerberg and company didn’t recognize the tenuousness of their position in the social media market—wherein their competitors’ products are merely a few clicks away—they would be running as lean as they did in previous quarters. That’s accountability at work, urged by the specter of the nosedive into irrelevance of competitors such as MySpace and more recently, SnapChat. 

## Accountability Absent Market Pressure?

Why hasn’t the dynamic between citizens and government undergone a similar revolution in bottom-up accountability? First of all, it’s worth noting that governments are investing in IT systems to improve efficiency, but that high regulatory barriers make this process slow and less efficient than it is for companies. Secondly, accountability to citizens is a different than a business’s accountability to its customers; both are service providers, but if a business can’t solve a problem in a suitable way and at palatable cost, in most markets, a customer has the option to go back to the market and find another provider. However, if a citizen has a bad experience at the Department of Motor Vehicles, there’s no other DMV; how can there be accountability when there’s no competition? In response, technologists, hackers and internal advocates in government around the globe are banding together to create [“civic technologies“](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_technology) which enable citizens to access and visualize government data, report on service delivery, claim their rights, and to hold their governments accountable for their actions and inactions. Four active DAI projects developing civic tech projects that give citizens the power to hold their governments accountable.

In Malawi, the USAID Local Government Accountability and Performance (LGAP) project partnered with mHub to develop an SMS-based accountability system for market vendors and other citizens to report poor service delivery to local District Councils. This system, called Mzinda, is live in 64 markets around Malawi and has seen more than 2,500 reports sent, better connecting citizens and their local governments.

The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governance Program (KPG) in Pakistan recently debuted the Raye-o-Rah tool, which is designed to collect citizen inputs related to municipal performance for the Local Government Good Governance Index (LGGGI). LGGGI is indexed monthly and aims to generate competition in the form of a race-to-the-top among municipalities for responsiveness and accountability.

In Guatemala, the Nexos Locales project and DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration are currently in preparations for the release of version 2 of Somos Chiantla, a transparency-based accountability tool that gives citizens direct access to live budget data, direct from their municipal finance office, as well as the ability to report local issues such as potholes and broken street lights.

The USAID- Liberia Accountability and Voice Initiative project is supporting Liberia’s new Accountability Lab, an “innovation campus” which will work closely with local entrepreneurs, technologists, government officials, and non-profits to design and develop tools to push public institutions toward accountability, good governance, and proper service delivery in Liberia.
