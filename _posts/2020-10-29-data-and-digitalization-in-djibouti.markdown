Earlier this year, and what feels like a lifetime ago, I found myself staring out at the arid countryside from the back of a white Landcruiser, bouncing along a bumpy road shared with camel herders, barefoot migrants, and a growing swarm of locusts. I had traveled to Djibouti with a small team of colleagues for what would be my first, last, and only overseas trip of 2020. Though unknowingly on the cusp of a global pandemic, COVID-19 had not yet permeated the African continent and our focus was on the task at hand: examining Djibouti’s humanitarian data ecosystem. Our mission was to explore how government, non-government organizations, and refugees understand, collect, use, and share humanitarian data. We began this undertaking, called a data ecosystem rapid assessment or “DERA,” with desk research and followed with two weeks in-country interviewing as many stakeholders as we could.

## A Strategic Partner for Regional Security

The DERA was funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) through the DAI-implemented [Digital Frontiers](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df) project. But where even *is* Djibouti and why does the U.S. Government care about it?

A tiny and often overlooked country, Djibouti serves as a strategic transit point in the Horn of Africa, attractive to investors and military operations for its access to the region’s busy shipping routes via the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. As a politically stable nation amidst a region rife with geopolitical tension, entrenched Al Qaeda affiliates, and poor socioeconomic indicators, Djibouti is a haven for more than 30,000 registered refugees and asylum seekers, primarily from neighboring Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Yemen. It also serves as a transit country for 11,500 migrants crossing the Gulf of Aden each month. The U.S. Government supports Djibouti’s development as a stable democracy and as a partner against regional threats through foreign assistance to sectors such as education, workforce development, economic growth, health, and food security.

The DERA’s objective was to offer findings and recommendations to specifically inform USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (USAID/BHA) interventions and improve stakeholder coordination in view of the agency’s long-standing support to private international and voluntary organizations (PIOs and PVOs) combating food insecurity and malnutrition within Djibouti’s refugee camps.

## Six Data Ecosystem Observations

With this mission in mind, our DERA team led by USAID’s Mikael Baker held interviews in the capital of Djibouti Ville, from the modest offices of the National Institute of Statistics to the glossy highrise that houses the World Bank and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) offices. To gather information about how refugee feedback is communicated, monitored, and addressed—a sub-objective of the DERA—we then set out along desert highways to visit each of the country’s three refugee settlements: Holl-Holl, Markazi, and Ali Addeh. Over the course of two weeks, we met with more than 80 individuals via 26 individual or small group interviews and one focus group discussion. Below are six key observations from these conversations.

**1. The Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework is reorienting the humanitarian response in Djibouti.** In 2016, following the UN’s [New York Refugee and Migrant Summit](https://refugeesmigrants.un.org/sites/default/files/public_summary_document_refugee_summit_final_11-11-2016.pdf#:\~:text=Leaders%E2%80%99%20Summit%20on%20Refugees%20On%2020%20September%202016%2C,the%20international%20community%E2%80%99s%20capacity%20to%20address%20mass%20displacement.), the Government of Djibouti (GoDj) began implementing the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF). Under the CRRF, Djibouti made commitments to support the socioeconomic inclusion of refugees in social protection, the justice system, education, health care, and more. Following the development of a National Action Plan in 2017, the GoDj began an ongoing process to revise the roles and elevate the authorities of certain ministries and departments, shifting some donor-supported humanitarian services to the responsibility of GoDj. While the international community has praised Djibouti’s steps toward reform, some ministries have responded to the reorientation with resistance, competing for responsibilities in GoDj humanitarian response. It remains to be seen what implications may result from this shift, particularly for responsibilities that were previously overseen by international donors.

**2. Stakeholders across the sector show increased interest in digitization and digitalization.** Donors and GoDj are investing resources into digitizing data, upgrading data systems, and digitalizing organizational processes—from investments in [DHIS2](https://www.dhis2.org/) by Djibouti’s Ministry of Health to the use of biometrics for identity validation by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Solidarity (MASS) and the World Food Programme (WFP). However, financial and human capacity may limit the utility of an increased quantity of data, as well as the sustainability and interoperability of new and upgraded data systems.

**3. Bottlenecks in data collection are a key concern for all stakeholder groups.** The Djibouti National Statistics Institute (INSD) approves all national data collection efforts. Additionally, it recruits enumerators only from the regions of Djibouti where the data will be collected, to facilitate communication between respondents and enumerators familiar with the communities, culture, and languages of the target geographic area. The enumerator cadre has high turnover and capacity constraints, partially due to the temporary employment status. When multiple organizations want to collect data at the same time, INSD cannot always meet demand, which delays data collection efforts.

**4. Stakeholders share limited data, mostly informally.** Data are not regularly shared between stakeholders. This is true for raw data as well as published studies and reports. There are few formal data-sharing agreements and MOUs between stakeholders. Efforts to coordinate stakeholders on this issue across the humanitarian space are piecemeal and inconsistent, with regularly occurring data sharing seemingly limited to between donors and their implementing partners, and between certain United Nations agencies.

**5. Feedback is slipping through the cracks.** A key DERA objective was to understand existing refugee feedback processes to inform the development of a digital beneficiary feedback mechanism (BFM). A digital BFM is a software platform for systematic management of feedback, complaints, and requests from beneficiaries (in this case, refugees). We observed a number of efforts by PIOs and PVOs to advertise reporting hotlines or complaint drop boxes, but we found that they either weren’t known or accessible to refugees, or weren’t effectively monitored and acted upon, leading to infrequent use. As a result, most reporting is being conveyed verbally with varying degrees of successful follow-up.

**6. Development of a digital BFM is underway.** We also learned that the WFP is already preparing to roll out SugarCRM, its global BFM platform, in Djibouti, and plans to coordinate with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other organizations for its implementation. This digital BFM shows promise in reducing the instances of feedback slipping through the cracks by not reaching the appropriate stakeholders, provided that refugees are engaged and consulted throughout its design and deployment. Key to its success will be making sure the BFM is understood, trusted, and utilized by these beneficiaries, as well as those responsible for following up on feedback. *(Note: DAI has written extensively about the importance of user-centered design in our [Frontier Insights](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/digital-acceleration-solutions/insights-for-emerging-markets) research publications.)*

## What’s Next?

We’re finalizing a report for USAID/BHA detailing the findings and recommendations from Djibouti Humanitarian DERA. We hope to be able to share some key recommendations with you soon.

In the meantime, check out DAI’s recent posts ([Part 1](https://dai-global-digital.com/management-information-systems-at-the-humanitarian-social-protection-nexus-interoperability.html) and [Part 2](https://dai-global-digital.com/management-information-systems-at-the-humanitarian-social-protection-nexus-part-2-risks-and-benefits.html)) providing an overview of management information systems at the humanitarian-social protection nexus, supported by case studies in Yemen and South Sudan. For greater detail, this [Review and Analysis of Identification and Registration Systems in Protracted and Recurrent Crises](https://www.dai.com/uploads/bsic-MIS-2020.pdf) is publicly available as well.
