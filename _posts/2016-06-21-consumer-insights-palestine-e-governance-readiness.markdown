*“You’re doing this on the first day of Ramadan? Everyone is fasting and grumpy! I was going to tell you to leave me alone, but you are a guest and have a kind face so I will answer your questions!”*

That was the joking response I received from a local fabric store owner in Ramallah when I asked whether he had a few minutes to spare to help me with some research I was doing.

In June I traveled to the West Bank in Palestine with a few colleagues to investigate key aspects of Palestinian readiness for electronic governance (E-Gov) systems in Palestine at the local level. As part of an attempt to explore potential improvements in municipal service delivery and citizen engagement, I conducted a citizen survey to help us better understand how Palestinians receive and share information using technology, and how they interact with local municipalities.

Over the course of a week I traveled to 3 cities in the West Bank and interviewed 81 Palestinian citizens from 15 different municipalities and different walks of life. We call this type of rapid, dirty data collection Consumer Insights – a tool that allows our project teams to quickly make user and data driven decisions about appropriate ICT interventions and which we have deployed in Jordan, Honduras, Indonesia and now Palestine.

Key overarching questions that I hoped to explore included:
•   What kinds of mobile technologies are Palestinians using regularly?
•   How do Palestinians receive and share information?
•   What kinds of interactions do Palestinians regularly have with their municipalities
•   Would Palestinians see value in access to E-Gov services?
 The key insights from the data are summarized below:

Technology and Internet Access: Smart People using Smartphones
Palestinians are not only exceptionally well educated, they are also unsurprisingly very tech savvy. Every last survey respondent own at least one mobile phone (2 in 5 owned multiple phones). The overwhelming majority own smartphones which they identify as their primary gateway to the internet: highlighting the global trend towards mobile device supremacy in terms of internet access. 3G frequencies are not yet available to Palestinian network operators (3G availability is planned for later this year), meaning that even on their phones Palestinians must access the internet through ISP-backed Wi-Fi networks, to which 86% of respondents had access at home.

People speak with their wallets. How much a person spends on communications technology says a lot about how important the ability to communicate electronically is to their every day lives and livelihoods. Palestinians spend a significant amount of money on mobile communications. Women, men, young people, business owners – regardless of the demographic, average expenditure on mobile phone  usage was consistently around $50 per month, a considerable amount of income.

Facebook and Whatsapp rule: How people receive and share information
The words “Facebook” and “Whatsapp” were ubiquitous in the answers of interviewees when exploring how people communicate and share information. Not only were Facebook and Whatsapp the most consistently cited mobile applications amongst respondents when asked what their most used mobile apps were (an observation that held true across each demographic), they were both used more than traditional SMS messages to communicate with friends and family. Despite Facebook and Whatsapp topping the charts, Palestinians also cited other messaging platforms such as Viber, Tango, Kik, and Line, though it was clear that none of these platforms reached the popularity as the former.
Somewhat surprisingly, Facebook also topped the list when it came to the question of where people get their local news. 59 respondents cited facebook as a primary means for receiving local news updates compared with 36 mentioning television and just 23 mentioning old school print media, with youth in particular relying almost solely on electronic news sources.

When exploring smartphone application preferences, it becomes clear that smartphone owners in Palestine use apps primarily for communication and social interaction purposes. Again, Facebook and Whatsapp top the list of most used applications, with other messaging and social media apps like Viber and Instagram receiving many further mentions. The only non-social media / messaging application be mentioned more than 5 times was Youtube.

Disconnected: Citizen-Municipality Interaction
While a good half of the respondents had paid a visit to their local municipality within the past two years, less than one third had ever visited their municipality’s website, suggesting a combination of lack of web-based municipal service offerings and a lack of public awareness in municipalities that offer such services. Furthermore, the vast majority of those that had recently visited their municipality had done so in order to complete repetitive tasks such as paying utility bills or taxes. This suggests a high potential for increased efficiency and improved user experience through e-services, not least for the large numbers of diaspora Palestinians with property or business es in the West Bank.

What does this mean for future programs?
