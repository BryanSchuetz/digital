*“You’re doing this on the first day of Ramadan? Everyone is fasting and grumpy! I was going to tell you to leave me alone, but you are a guest and have a kind face so I will answer your questions!”*

That was the joking response I received from a local fabric store owner in Ramallah when I asked whether he had a few minutes to spare to help me with some research I was doing.

In June I traveled to the West Bank in Palestine with a few colleagues to investigate aspects of Palestinian readiness for electronic governance (E-Gov) systems at the local level. As part of an attempt to explore potential improvements in municipal service delivery and citizen engagement, I conducted a citizen survey to help us better understand how Palestinians receive and share information using technology, and how they interact with local municipalities.

Over the course of a week I traveled to 3 cities in the West Bank and interviewed 81 Palestinian citizens from 15 different municipalities and different walks of life. We call this type of rapid, dirty data collection Consumer Insights – a tool that allows our project teams to quickly make user and data driven decisions about appropriate ICT interventions and which we have deployed in Jordan, Honduras, Indonesia and now Palestine.

Key overarching questions that I hoped to explore included:

* What kinds of mobile technologies are Palestinians using regularly?

* How do Palestinians receive and share information?

* What kinds of interactions do Palestinians regularly have with their municipalities

* Is there a demand for E-Gov services among citizens?
  

The key insights from the data are summarized below:

## What is the Data telling us?

The insights taken from the survey data tell us unequivocally that Palestinians are tech savvy and well connected to information flows. They are active online and on social media, and rely on social media platforms like Facebook and Whatsapp for more than entertainment - they use these platforms for regular communication and to receive and send information, including local news. Palestinians across all demographics appear to be relying on web-based mobile technology to communicate with one another

###The Disconnect: Municipal Services
While citizens are using the web to communicate and engage one another directly on a daily basis, their interactions with Municipalities appear are very different. Citizens are making time consuming in-person visits to conduct routine municipal business





While a good half of the respondents had paid a visit to their local municipality within the past two years, less than one third had ever visited their municipality’s website, suggesting a combination of lack of web-based municipal service offerings and a lack of public awareness in municipalities that offer such services. Furthermore, the vast majority of those that had recently visited their municipality had done so in order to complete repetitive tasks such as paying utility bills or taxes. This suggests a high potential for increased efficiency and improved user experience through e-services, not least for the large numbers of diaspora Palestinians with property or business es in the West Bank.`
