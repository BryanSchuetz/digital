The [Public Diplomacy and Outreach Project in India and SAARC](http://dai.com/our-work/projects/south-asia%E2%80%94eu-public-diplomacy-and-outreach-india-and-south-asian-association) is an EU-funded project that DAI has been implementing since December 2013, with Marco Corsi as team leader. In line with the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy strategy in Asia, this project aims to deepen the political, economic, and cultural relationships between the EU and India and the SAARC nations (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation), and to promote EU visibility by organising various events, supporting local cultural organisations and setting up active ICT platforms and new means of communications.

# Promoting European higher education

Included in the project’s initiatives is the outreach of European Higher Education. In 2014, the EUD to India along with the EU Member States (MS) missions in New Delhi organised the European Higher Education Fair. The fair was held in New Delhi, Bengaluru and Kolkata over the course of a week and attracted the participation of 118 Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) from 23 EU MS. It was attended by more than 6,500 students and parents in these three cities.  The event was promoted energetically through the traditional media and advertising as well as newly emergent social media channels and received widespread coverage both online and offline.

# From in-person to virtual: the digitization of the education fair

In 2015, built on the success of the previous fair, the team set up a European Higher Education Virtual Fair - an online platform to reach out to prospective students in India/ South Asia through web presence, chat sessions, and webinars. The virtual fair was interactive and participatory with direct contribution by the HEIs complementing their efforts in promoting internationalization of higher education in the EU. This initiative was a first of its kind globally, proven to be less cost-intensive with greater outreach.

The starting point for the EHEVF 2015 was the creation of a master portal (http://study-europe.net) carrying relevant information such as admission announcements, scholarship, summer schools and internship opportunities, and research grants, costs/fee structure of different courses/institutions. On a longer term perspective, the portal is meant to become a one-stop destination for networking and to host all information and best practices about the achievements in the space of EU and India (and South Asia as applicable) higher education, making this initiative modular, repeatable and sustainable.

Each participating 138 HEI from 28 EU MS had one webpage/micro-site on the website ready for the launch of the fair on the 26th of November 2015. Until the 29th the fair comprised of a series of subject wide webinars to enable the HEIs to reach out to prospective students. Separately there were webinars featuring HEIs listed in the Times Higher Education global rankings of leading universities 2015-16 participating in EHEVF. Individual EU MS were invited to address Country sessions and 7 such country webinar sessions were held. Finally there were also thematic webinar sessions on topics such as EU scholarships and research opportunities, Visa, Living in an EU MS and Alumni speak.

In addition, the students who registered on the website had the possibility to interact with the EU HEIs through Q&A and Chat Sessions. The Chat sessions were live during 8 hours every day during the fair. Before and after the Chat session timings, the students could always leave behind their queries in the Q&A window available on every institution’s page.

# Value for money, with value for users

Feedback from the fair has been positive from both prospective students and HEIs. The team agree further technical improvements can be made with recommendations on how to make future events better, but the overall experience of the platform was well received with an overwhelming majority (about 80%) of respondents positively assessing their time on the EHEVF (from good to excellent). This form of communication and outreach on our project has been done at a regional level, but it has the realistic possibility of becoming a global virtual fair. Detailed usage data can be found below for those interested!

# Portal

The portal received a surge of traffic during the virtual fair and recorded 8,116 sessions and 5,159 unique visitors over the four days (26-29 November 2015), with an average time of 7 min 43 sec spent by each visitor (higher in comparison to similar websites/ events).

# Webinars

Over four intense days as many as 76 webinars of 30 minutes each, many of them in parallel, were organised for EU HEIs and speakers to engage. A total of 3,243 participants (log-ins) were recorded. (Actual number would be higher due to screen sharing among students and institutional screening in some places).

# Registrations

The main objective of the EHEVF marketing and outreach campaign was carried out through Facebook, marketing support agencies and on-ground college campus activations in Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chennai. 13,592 students’ registrations were achieved through all channels and partners combined.

The portal will be hosting the 2016 VEHEF, with discussions to follow on how to sustain this initiative past the life of DAI’s project, with the possibility of making this a one stop destination for students who want to get info on study opportunities in the EU.
