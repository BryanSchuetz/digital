Everyone is talking about digital transformation—especially now that digital processes and tools are a mandatory part of daily activities for most businesses, schools, and citizens across the world in response to the global COVID-19 outbreak. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and DAI have been working to enhance digital skills, improve connectivity, and enable locally led innovation for years. Today, we are all confronted with a new set of urgent challenges. How do we ensure that citizens can safely and effectively use digital technologies to advance their own economic livelihoods and those of their countries?

One of USAID’s most recent responses is the Digital Asia Accelerator, a three-year initiative implemented by DAI through the [Digital Frontiers](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df) project. The Digital Asia Accelerator aims to increase the safe and appropriate use of digital technologies across the region. Even before the pandemic, digital technology was transforming lives and business functions across the Indo-Pacific region. This rapid internet adoption and increase in connectivity has enormous potential to help boost economic growth, access to jobs, and increased incomes.

The initial operating countries for the Digital Asia Accelerator are Cambodia, Laos, Mongolia, Myanmar, and Thailand. The project’s objectives are to: (1) increase public awareness of digital safety issues, (2) strengthen digital skills of the private sector and civil society, and (3) strengthen the ability of private sector and civil society to engage on digital policy issues.
