Today DAI launches **Lean HCD: A Case Study in Human-Centered Design in the Highlands of Guatemala**. This landmark report is the culmination of 18 months of close collaboration between DAI's ICT team, the [USAID Nexos Locales](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/guatemala-nexos-locales) project, and the people of Chiantla, a municipality in the Western Highlands of Guatemala. 

Throughout this process, DAI used a lean human-centered design (HCD) approach, balancing HCD best practices with programmatic realities to build empathy with the people of Chiantla, understand their daily challenges and expectations of their municipal government, and create a tool to that responds to those expectations by improving citizens' ability to hold their mayor and his administration accountable. 

This process led to the design, development, and implementation of [Somos Chiantla], an Android-based, open-source mobile app that 

The product is called Somos Chiantla. 

How did we do it?
What tips do we have for other embarking on similarly complex design processes for international development projects?
