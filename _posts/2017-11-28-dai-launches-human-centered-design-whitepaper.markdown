Today DAI launches **Lean HCD: A Case Study in Human-Centered Design in the Highlands of Guatemala.** 

This whitepaper introduces the concept of Lean Human-Centered Design. 

What do we mean by Lean HCD? Why is this a useful approach for digital designers who work in international development? How did we use Lean HCD to develop empathy with a distant population and use that empathy to design a tool.
