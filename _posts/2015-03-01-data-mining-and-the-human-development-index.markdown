We love data mining at DAI and today we are going to mine a data set from the United Nations, and we are going to do so by first working through an illustrative four-wheeled example

### The Human Development Index
The UN maintains an index for 205 countries describing the overall level of human development of each country based on three major pillars: health, education and a standard of living. Specifically, the HDI Dataset from the UNDP is based on these four variables:

*Gross National Income
*Life Expectancy at Birth
*Expected Years of Schooling
*Mean Years of Schooling

Each country is indexed on those variables for every year from 1980 - 2013, with more data-completeness in years closer to 2013. The result of the index calculation is a single value, the HDI, describing the overall strength of human development based on four component variables. This is great because it provides a measurable data point on which to gauge progress over time and it helps focus aid in countries and sectors that need it most.
