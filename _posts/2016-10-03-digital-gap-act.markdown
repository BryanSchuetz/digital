Have you read the [Digital Global Access Policy (GAP) Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5537/text?) If you’re an ICT4D practitioner, you should.

The bill was just passed in the House (unanimously, no less), and is speeding toward a Senate vote. So, what’s it all about? In short, it enshrines the growth of affordable internet access as a tenet of U.S. foreign policy by promoting: 

1. First-time broadband internet access for at least 1.5 billion additional people in developing countries by 2020 
2. Internet capacity building in those countries
3. “Build-once policies” that encourage the construction of broadband conduit pipes during any public infrastructure project, particularly road building
4. Local policy change that encourages affordable internet access, and removes tax and regulatory barriers
5. The growth of the internet as a lever for economic growth and trade, democracy, transparency, and human rights
6. Improved access for women, people with disabilities, minorities, and underserved populations
7. Cybersecurity and data protection in the international sphere

## Why now?
For those who believe in the digital divide—both between countries and within them—the bill is welcome news. For marginalized populations themselves, it represents a lifeline from the world of Ubers and WhatsApps that is currently leaving them behind, both innovators and consumers. 

According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), [60 percent of the world’s population remains without internet access](http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/publications/misr2015/MISR2015-w5.pdf), and an estimated 75 percent of that population lives in just 20 countries and is [largely rural, female, elderly, illiterate, and low-income](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5537/text?). Internet access, provided at broadband speeds and at price points which are affordable—2 percent or less of monthly income, according to the Alliance for Affordable Internet’s [2015-2016 Internet Affordability Report](http://a4ai.org/affordability-report/)—will be a key driver of the next epoch of global gains in incomes, equality, rights, and security around the world. 

## Implementation
So how is it actually going to happen? The bill charges the State Department, Peace Corps, and USAID with the implementation of the policy, but says little about how they should go about doing so, only that the president has 180 days after the passage of the act to deliver an implementation plan to Congress. That being the case, I have two questions for readers:

1. Did you read the bill differently? What am I missing? 

2. The President just appointed you to his Special Task Force for the Implementation of the Digital GAP Act. What would you have State, USAID, and the Peace Corps do? How would they work together to help affordable internet reach those living past the last mile? What about funding, given that the [Congressional Budget Office estimates implementation at only $500,000]( https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51942)(Feed the Future it is not)?
