The award is presented each year by the U.S. State Department, the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, and Concordia. In its [analysis ](https://ideas.darden.virginia.edu/2018/09/kosmos-innovation-center-a-p3-partnership/) of the KIC model, Darden School faculty members concluded that [KIC](https://dai-global-digital.com/catalyzing-ghanas-growing-agritech-ecosystem.html) has “begun to demonstrate the great potential of cross-sector partnerships to enable not only individual empowerment, but also fundamental societal transformation.” 

Congratulations also to our fellow 2018 finalists: DREAMS Partnership, Griha Pravesh, Lake Kivu Coffee Alliance, and MIP Futuro.
