The Olympic Games Rio are over! It’s too bad. We all had fun watching the world’s greatest athletes come together and compete. At these Olympic games we saw several displays of complete dominance from competitors like Usain Bolt, Katie Ledecky, and Michael Phelps. Watching their races, it struck me how easy they made it look, with Usain Bolt laughing in his prelims, Ledecky winning by 11 seconds, and Phelps winning by over a body length in a race that is only four laps in the pool. 

The skill of making it look easy, which comes with learning to relax while exerting maximum effort is one that takes a lifetime to master, and is a technique athletes work towards constantly to perfect over years of practice. In an article titled [“Why Joggers Labor and Olympians Fly”](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/10/health/why-joggers-labor-and-olympians-fly-the-science-of-the-long-distance-runner.html), exercise physiologist Dr. Fitts says that a “good runner should almost be able to run with an apple balanced on their head”. That is hard to do when you’re running as fast as you can!
