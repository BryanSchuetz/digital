The terms “Machine Learning” and “Artificial Intelligence” conjure up feelings that are equal parts fear and fascination. Why is that? Until recently, the prospect of a piece of software making human-like decisions resided safely in the far-fetched expectations of 1960's era computer scientists, and in the plot lines of science fiction novels. Today, however, after [decades of unmet expectations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter), we finally have AI systems that are beginning to augment our lives. Voice recognition systems like Amazon's Echo and Apple's Siri, and once-unimaginable fantasies like self-driving cars are on the market for consumers, with more exciting life-like systems to come. We have also seen a few early signs of robotic autonomy that makes us feel uneasy, like that [Russian robot that leaned how to escape the lab!](http://qz.com/709161/its-happening-a-robot-escaped-a-lab-in-russia-and-made-a-dash-for-freedom/).   

Macine Learning or ML is a branch of AI that relies on data. And we, the addicted users of the internet, have been providing the training data for the last 15 or so years. ML is indeed here and in our lives in many helpful ways. Language translation services on the web learn from gigabytes of translated text constantly fed into the system, Google’s self-driving cars are learning by driving millions of miles of roads. Facebook can auto-caption images to help visually impaired users partake in social media. Even the postal service is using these new technologies. Ever wonder why it is so cheap to send a letter across the country? The USPS uses ML to read hand-written addresses and automatically route them to their destination. Other parts of the government are using ML to [automate easy decisions](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/11/18/automating-easy-government-decisions-with-machine-learning/). On the horizon are [self-flying personal planes](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-09/welcome-to-larry-page-s-secret-flying-car-factories), because apparently automating a path through the air is easier than navigating a chaotic city street. Lifelike writing is getting better too. Can you tell who wrote these poems: [human or machine?](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/06/27/480639265/human-or-machine-can-you-tell-who-wrote-these-poems)

The potential for ML applications in international development is huge. How? Let's look at an example: The Google Photos App on my phone has access to 6,345 photos. I have never once tagged any of my photos with a category. And I don't need to because Google Photos tags them automatically with ML. By comparing the image structures of the photos on my phone with the millions Google already knows of, it can auto-tag them with keywords like "beach", "food" or "group photo". Here is what happens when I search with the beach keyword:

```Google's Photos App uses ML to tag photos```

Tagging each photo manually would have been time consuming and error prone. In that way, this ML-driven clustering approach can be applied to tasks that would normally require hundreds of hours of mundane manual work. USAID’s WIE project is looking at machine learning as way to automate the alignment of unstructured CVs and resumes with available jobs. This type of large-scale unstructured text processing is prohibitively slow to do by hand but made entirely achievable with the help of software that can read and make an educated guess based on the rarity of the terms in a CV. 

But don’t we always need a human in the loop? Well, yes most of these systems still need close human supervision. But before we continue marching around on our non-robotic high horse, let’s reflect for a moment on the hilariously flawed ways we make decisions today. Here are a few: Parole boards make decisions differently later in the day, because of [decision fatigue!](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html) Is that fair? The great lengths researchers go to just to prevent [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) is astounding. We, with our own money and against our own judgement, make poor investment decisions based on cognitive biases like [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs). Actually, just look at this huge list of [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases), or patterns that lead us to make irrational decisions. Is human judgement really that great?
