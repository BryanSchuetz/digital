Any digital designer worth their salt will admit it: most tech tools fail. At least the first time around. Getting your users to drop the of old way of doing things and use your new web site (or gadget, or app) isn’t easy. It doesn’t matter if it visualizes their transactions in some really clever way, or sends their user data to the cloud for real-time analysis, or even if it saves them time or money; Behavior change is difficult, and doubly-so when you’re designing across cultures. Why? A few reasons: 

1. Targeting your value proposition. It’s difficult to understand your tool’s [value proposition](XXXXXX) when you don’t fully understand your users’ challenges, motivations, and experience. Is it actually better than the other immediately available alternatives? 

2. Fear of change. Convincing people that your new way will lower their costs (time or money) and make their life easier or better isn’t easy, especially when they may not be accustomed to using their phones (for example) for anything other than calls and texts. 

3. User interface. It might make perfect sense to you that you just click this button, swipe left, and choose your favorite option, but each step toward [conversion](XXXXXX) isn’t 100% clear from the first instant; if the buttons are the too small, or the wrong shape, or there are too many steps in the process, your users will smile and thank you, and promptly forget your app. 

All of this is to say that it’s difficult to gauge how your intended users will react to your tool until you have a prototype (or live version) to put in front of them. Acknowledging this is what separates the great products from the good ones, and the good ones from the… not-so-good ones. That’s why human-centered design, design thinking, and other user-centered design methods exist: to provide a road-map for designers to test assumptions about their tool before launch, to learn based on direct user experience, and to apply those learnings to new iterations of the tool. 

With learning and iteration in mind, the USAID Development Innovations (DI) project in Cambodia is running a “Second Chance Fund”; a small grant competition for local CSOs whose tech ideas didn’t pan out on the first try, but who have worked closely with their users to understand why not, learned what’s working and what’s not, and applied those learnings to a proposal for a new iteration of their concept. 

Chief of Party Kate Heuisler says that DI decided to run the Second Chance Fund “to emphasize to our Cambodian CSOs partners the importance of brutally honest self-reflection and learning. It doesn’t matter where you’re from, it can be difficult to be objective about your work, especially when future funding rides on telling a story of success. We wanted to flip that dynamic on its head so we put the incentive on learning and iteration.” 
Beyond that, the Fund was a significant departure from the typical USAID sub-grant process in other ways. Instead of a 50-page grant solicitation, DI kept the document to 6 pages to lower the barriers to entry for potential participants. The solicitation asked applicants to submit a brief concept note describing the first iteration of their digital tool, how it had fallen short of expectations, what they had learned about why, how they had engaged users in that learning process, and what they proposed for their second round of development. Selected concept notes then gave an in-person presentation to DI’s Grant Evaluation Committee, which selected the concepts which had the most potential for impact and displayed clear evidence of learning and user engagement in their processes.
