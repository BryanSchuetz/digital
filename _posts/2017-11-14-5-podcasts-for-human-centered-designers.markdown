In international development, human-centered design is predicated on a designer's ability to rapidly develop empathy with a population--especially the the cultural, political, and economic dynamics that affect them--and to parlay that understanding into a localized solution to a local problem. Doing so successfully requires one primary skill: **listening.** That means listening in the traditional sense: to an individual during a [Digital Insights](https://dai-global-digital.com/rwanda-digital-insights.html) field interview, but more broadly, listening for design in the international development space means listening not just to an individual but listening to a population. The podcasts below are all about people who know how to listen. They've expanded my understanding of design and sharpened my understanding of how to listen and make decisions when I'm designing a solution. I hope they'll do the same for you. 
 
## Design Matters with Debbie Millman

* **File Under:** Deep interviews, designer empathy
* **Why is it useful for HCD practitioners?** Great interviews with all types of designers. Millman is a graphic designer who has worked for all the big names, but in her podcast she's a psychologist with her patient on the couch, dissecting designers' thought processes and decision-making. Designers will want to pay close attention to Millman's interview style and emulate her active listening.

## Masters of Scale with Reid Hoffman

* **File Under:** Deep interviews, tech heroes
* **Why is it useful?:** Reid Hoffman is the tech world’s closest thing to the Oracle of Delphi. As the COO at PayPal and then co-founded LinkedIn, Hoffman now advises other start-up founders on how to tackle the challenges of scaling up their concepts. His podcast is a chance to sit in on those conversations and understand how to tech concepts go from idea to start-up to scale-up. Designers would do well to pay close attention to how Hoffman and his guests describe their thought processes around scale-up during the initial design phase, as most (all?) tech tools designed for the international development space are intended to be scaled-up.

* **File Under:** Deep interviews, tech heroes
* **Why is it useful for HCD practitioners?** Ferris is the author of “The 4-Hour Work Week” and a serial entrepreneur. On his podcast, Ferriss interviews A-List tech heroes and digs deep to understand who they were before they were successful designers, how they came up with their concept, how they tested it, and how they took it from idea to product.

## 99% Invisible

* **File Under:** Design history, physical spaces
* **Why is it useful for HCD practitioners?** Roman Mars presents famous 
and intriguing design cases from the past and present and breaks down the "why." Looking at cases ranging from Antoni Gaudi's Sagrada Familia cathedral in Barcelona to the "Doll Houses" of St. Louis, Mars explores the design process as well as the social, political, and economic context that explain the problem, solution, or case.

## UX Podcast

* **File under:** User experience, Swedish perspective
* **Why is it useful for HCD practitioners?** A more wry take on design from James Royal-Lawson and Per Axbom (his real name) primarily concerned with the nuts and bolts of digital design like user experience, user interface, but also broader takes on design, the tech business, and the distinctions between the American and Swedish approach to design.
