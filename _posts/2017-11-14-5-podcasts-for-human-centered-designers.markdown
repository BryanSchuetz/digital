**File Under:** Deep interviews, designer empathy
**Why is it useful for HCD practitioners?** Great interviews with all types of designers. Millman is a graphic designer who has worked for all the big names, but in her podcast she's a psychologist with her patient on the couch, dissecting designers' thought processes and decision-making. Designers will want to pay close attention to Millman's interview style and emulate her active listening.

## Masters of Scale with Reid Hoffman
![Masters.jpeg](/uploads/Masters.jpeg)
**File Under:** Deep interviews, tech heroes
**Why is it useful?:** Reid Hoffman is the tech world’s closest thing to the Oracle of Delphi. As the COO at PayPal and then co-founded LinkedIn, Hoffman now advises other start-up founders on how to tackle the challenges of scaling up their concepts. His podcast is a chance to sit in on those conversations and understand how to tech concepts go from idea to start-up to scale-up. Designers would do well to pay close attention to how Hoffman and his guests describe their thought processes around scale-up during the initial design phase, as most (all?) tech tools designed for the international development space are intended to be scaled-up.
