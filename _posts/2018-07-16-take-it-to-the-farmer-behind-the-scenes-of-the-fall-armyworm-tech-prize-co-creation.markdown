Along with human-centered design and lean startup, co-creation is an approach arising to prominence in the development lexicon over the past five years. Some of us (myself included) have used “co-creation” without  understanding what it means, simply assuming it was an event that brings together a variety of partners to brainstorm ideas to solve a problem. Only when I attended the [Fall Armyworm Tech Prize](https://fallarmywormtech.challenges.org/) co-creation workshop June 26–29 in Kampala, Uganda, did I grasp the nuances of co-creation and realize the significant benefits it holds for the end users of co-created products.

## **Seeking Innovators**

Fall armyworm is a [devastating pest](http://www.fao.org/food-chain-crisis/how-we-work/plant-protection/fallarmyworm/en/) that can destroy potentially millions of tons of crop yield across Africa, drastically reducing the incomes of smallholder farmers and those who rely on these crops for their livelihoods. In response to the 2016 fall armyworm outbreak, Feed the Future and  partners [Land O’Lakes International Development](https://www.landolakes.org/) and [Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research](https://foundationfar.org/) (FFAR), created the [Fall Armyworm Tech Prize](https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/agriculture-and-food-security/increasing-food-security-through-feed-future/fall-armyworm) competition to draw out digital tools and approaches that could provide timely, context-specific information that smallholder farmers and others could use to identify, treat, and track incidence of fall armyworm.

Twenty [finalists](https://fallarmywormtech.challenges.org/finalists-2/)—out of 228 applicants—were selected to attend a co-creation workshop, participate in interactive feedback sessions about their prototypes, and further develop these for the next phase of the competition. The workshop also convened partners from the private sector and government; experts and mentors in agriculture, technology, and business development; and, most importantly, the future users of these new tools and approaches—the farmers.

## **Collaboration Overtakes Competition**

My rudimentary understanding of co-creation within the prize process wrongfully pushed me to assume that although co-creation encourages collaboration, at its core this prize is a *competition*, and with five prizes totaling $400,000 on the line, the idea of *co*-creating could only be taken so far. I was very wrong.

Co-creation creates an environment that *unites* competitors. Our three-and-a-half days were filled with sessions that unpacked the problem of fall armyworm, incorporated human-centered design in prototype development, developed business plans (including fundraising, costing models, and communications), considered ways to measure impact, and hosted sales pitches. 

These sessions helped the finalists understand how to improve their ideas, but what happened behind the scenes was where the spirit of co-creation really took flight. It seemed that competition was replaced by a strong focus on *collaboration* to solve this endemic problem. It might have been a coffee break where someone recommended an data analytics tool to integrate into a potential solution, or a lunch where two finalist groups decided to join forces—the heartbeat of co-creation happened when I least expected it.

A few examples:

* Several finalists proposed digital tools that use machine learning to help farmers and extension workers identify the pest. Early on, they realized that their tools lacked ample imagery of fall armyworm. In response, those innovators brainstormed over dinner how to create an image bank to train their classification models. Regardless if these finalists win the top prize, this co-creative effort could ultimately help decrease or prevent damage to farm yields.<br><br>

* On Day 2, finalists pitched their ideas to partners, potential investors, and farmers at an exhibition-like  Marketplace. Many finalists used this opportunity to have farmers test their digital tools and provide feedback on how to make them more user friendly and helpful given farmers' technological constraints. Continual interaction with farmers during the workshop allowed participants to appreciate the needs of farmers as they built and iterated their tools.<br><br>

* Finally, on the last day, one of the finalists collected the phone numbers of the others and created a WhatsApp group for all to bounce ideas off one another and share approaches during the remainder of the prize process.<br>

Together these examples embody the key to a successful co-creation: **Give people the space and time to go beyond the program’s structure and work together in their own way to achieve a common goal.** As we move toward the next phase of the prize process, I look forward to seeing how the solutions are fueled by this collaboration and farmer engagement.

FFAR Executive Director Dr. Sally Rockey (pictured above) closed the workshop by quoting agricultural development pioneer Dr. Norman Borlaug's plea to developers of technology: “Take it to the farmer.” This sentiment was taken to heart by the Fall Armyworm Tech Prize finalists as they looked past the prize money to focus on co-creating solutions with farmers to address farming challenges.
