Some incredible things were happening in the U.S in 1972: Bill Withers Lean on Me was the number one song, the first Godfather film was released, and NASA launched the first in a series of satellites designed to provide consistent and reliable coverage of the earthâ€™s land cover. The platform, called the Earth Resources Technology Satellite or ERTS-1 was developed in partnership with USGS, who agreed to handle the storage and archiving and distribution of the data products. The second satellite, eventually renamed Landsat 2 launched in 1975, operating in parallel with ERTS-1 for a few years unti the original satellite was decommissioned.
 
In the late 1980s, the program hit hard times, reporting few users of the data, and scrutiny from congress. It was saved only through direct intervention from Vice President Dan Quayle, who perhaps should be remembered more for saving Landsat than an unfortunate incident with a chalkboard. 

Today, Landsat8 and Landsat 7 are operating concurrently. Here is the mission schedule from USGS
