As we’ve ramped up our [Consumer Insights](http://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=consumer-insights) work over the last few months, we’ve had the opportunity to talk with people around the Middle East, Latin America, Asia, and Africa about the digital tools they use to stay in touch with each other and the world around them. These conversations have reminded us that we have to work hard to stay on top of the growing number of messaging apps on the market today, as what was popular six months ago might no longer be today. “App-a-Thon 2016” is our way of quickly immersing ourselves in different messaging apps to learn about their functionality, look and feel. How does it work? The entire DAI ICT team signs up for a platform, and for one week, we use it to chat with each other, send images and video, and explore the quirks and features of the app.

Last time we covered [WhatsApp.](http://dai-global-digital.com/whatsapp-appathon-2016.html) This week, we’re talking about another Facebook property: Messenger.

**Pros:** Rides on the back of Facebook, which is used by more than a billion people, according to Facebook. Just like with WhatsApp, many phones come pre-loaded with Messenger. Features! GIF search adds flavor to conversations and the secret basketball and chess games are hidden gems. Payments open up major possibilities. Accessible via web browser.

**Cons:** What happened to Facebook private messages? I.E., Facebook and Messenger used to be one app--now they’re two. This distinction is confusing a lot of people. Feature overload? Is development of the app happening too quickly

**Adam:** First of all, let me start off by saying:

John: Love it. The GIF search is too much fun to ignore. 
John: So ah, did you know that you and me share one crazy trait with a billion other people? This chart is from 2016:
