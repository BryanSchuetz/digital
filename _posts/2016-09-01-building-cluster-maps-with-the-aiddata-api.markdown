AidData is an awesome organization. They've built s lightning fast API that exposes all massive amount of structured data about aid finances, projects, locations, and sources of funding. 

We built a super simple data explorer for GIS elements within the AidData API

More broadly and quoted from their Twitter bio, AidData is "A research and innovation lab based at @williamandmary providing tools and services to make development finance more transparent and effective."
