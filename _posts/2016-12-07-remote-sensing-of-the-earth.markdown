One day in 1800 German-born British citizen and musician-turned-astronomer, Sir James Herschel was doing something we’ve all found ourselves doing on lazy sunday afternoons. That’s right he was playing around with a prism, investigating the temperature differences between the bands of colorful light that refracts in different wavelengths and splays out in this familiar natural sequence

Sir James then placed a thermometer underneath each color and took note of the difference in temperature. He put another thermometer to the left of the red light, outside the range of the colored light. That’s when something unexpected happened: the highest temperature was found there, left of the red area outside of the visible range! 

Sir James discovered infrared light. Identifying for the first time a physical property of light that is most appropriately described by a cliche: there is more than meets the eye. While us humans can only see the light in the rainbow color spectrum, there is a far wider spectrum of light zipping through space, reflecting off things, revealing properties of the things it reflects against. This full spectrum of light comprising of both the colors visible to us humans and many other invisible bands is called the electromagnetic spectrum. It is hard to imagine invisible light but many of these invisible bands have familiar names like x-rays, microwaves, and radio waves. All of them are part of the same spectrum, just separated by the size of the wavelength.
