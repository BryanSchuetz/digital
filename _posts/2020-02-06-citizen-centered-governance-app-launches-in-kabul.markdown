*Note: This follows an earlier [post](https://dai-global-digital.com/citizen-centered-design-and-frontier-insights-in-kabul-municipality.html) that covers our pre-development human-centered design (HCD) phase.*

In recent years, Kabul residents have lamented the hours-long queue to access services at their municipal office. Several weeks ago, Kabul Municipality’s solution was hard to ignore. News of a new citizen engagement app was seen displayed on 21 billboards throughout the city, broadcast on [local television](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqLA8GD-33I&feature=youtu.be) and [online](http://www.outlookafghanistan.net/national_detail.php?post_id=25808) sites, shared on [social media](https://www.facebook.com/KabulMunicipality/posts/2194828510813555), and proudly showcased by the Mayor of Kabul at a launch event that drew 250 attendees and local media.

The launch was the culmination of a 16-month, multiphase initiative implemented by DAI’s [Strong Hubs for Afghan Hope and Resilience (SHAHAR)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/afghanistan-strong-hubs-afghan-hope-and-resilience-shahar) project to improve communication and engagement between local governments and their citizens, civil society, and businesses in Afghanistan. With technical guidance from DAI’s [Center for Digital Acceleration](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/digital-acceleration) (CDA)—including yours truly, Addie Ryan and Trevor Olexy, and former CDA-er Adam Fivenson—the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded SHAHAR worked alongside municipality counterparts in a consultative, iterative process to transform this initiative from vision to reality.

## Bringing Citizens to the Design Table

To ensure the app’s functionality aligned with the interests of local stakeholders, we guided SHAHAR through a HCD approach, working closely with the mayor, municipal departments, community leaders called *wakeel-e-guzars*, interested civil society, and citizens to deliver an application based on users’ needs and expectations. In the initial discovery phase, we mapped and then met with relevant stakeholders, identifying the objectives, data, systems, and commitment of the municipal staff. By applying [Frontier Insights](https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=digital-insights), DAI’s proprietary user discovery and research method, we explored the local digital ecosystem and learned how citizens in Kabul engage with technology. Data collected from citizen surveys informed a Design Thinking Session that convened key stakeholders to workshop the app concept, design, and functionalities. If you haven’t seen it, we wrote about our [Frontier Insights results in Kabul](https://dai-global-digital.com/citizen-centered-design-and-frontier-insights-in-kabul-municipality.html) in greater detail during the design phase.

The design process led us to four primary app functionalities:

1. **Municipal Plans and Information:** Kabul citizens can access detailed information about development plans, public services, municipal laws and regulations, tourist sites, and phone numbers for emergency services and key municipal personnel.
2. **Complaint Registration:** Kabul citizens no longer need to wait for “office hours” to register a complaint with the municipality. They can file and track a complaint anytime, anywhere from their smart phones and municipal staff will address their concerns.
3. **Safayi Fee Calculator:** Kabul citizens can calculate their annual *safayi* (property tax) fees directly through the Kabul Municipality’s mobile app and will no longer need to physically travel to their municipal office to do so.
4. **Municipality News:** Kabul citizens can follow news and discussions related to the municipality’s activities including easy access to the municipality’s Facebook page and website.

## Building the App Citizens Asked For

Once the design phase was complete, SHAHAR hired a local software development firm to build the application. While CDA provided technical feedback and guidance, SHAHAR’s all-star, Kabul-based ICT Municipal App Project Manager Hafizullah Shinwari provided day-to-day coordination and communication between the developers and Kabul Municipality counterparts. Absolutely critical to the success of this project was Hafizullah’s ability to keep things moving amidst bureaucratic delays, administration changeover, mission creep, and last-minute requests for changes. After several iterations, SHAHAR conducted user testing with 25 citizens—including government officials, *wakeel-e-guzars*, civil society representatives, and SHAHAR staff—and subsequently incorporated a second color theme and additional icons on the landing page to provide quicker access to important sub menus within the app.

## Launching the App for Citizen Engagement

Following a robust promotional campaign—including an animated promo broadcast on popular national TV stations in [Pashto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DpghQ8rXB4&feature=youtu.be) and [Dari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4n4kdJNBwM&feature=youtu.be)—and a successful launch event, the app quickly saw more than 1,000 downloads. SHAHAR is currently engaged in customized expansion of the app for Kandahar, Hirat, Jalalabad, and Mazar-e-Sharif. Government counterparts have expressed interest in further expansion and even presenting the app to President Ashraf Ghani. We’re thrilled to see citizens using the app and Kabul Municipality's commitment to improving service delivery through this platform.

> *“Now our citizens will be able to contact me or any other municipal official by simply clicking the button and registering their complaints. I promise that through this mobile application, the municipal services’ delivery to citizens will be quicker and more efficient than before.”*—Ahmad Zaki Sarfaraz, Mayor of Kabul
