That's a wrap for 2016, folks. We launched this blog in February with a sense of curiosity and caution, unsure who would read it—or if it would be read at all. Since then, we’ve grown steadily to more than 2,000 page views a month, collaborated with colleagues throughout the ICT4D ecosystem to host 12 guest author posts, and had the privilege of teammate [John DeRiggi](https://dai-global-digital.com/authors/john-deriggi/) being interviewed by the BBC’s program “[Click,](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006m9ry)” about his post on [Machine Learning in Afghanistan](https://dai-global-digital.com/machine-learning-will-help-development-projects-achieve-scale.html).

We’re looking forward to building upon this year’s successes in 2017 with more in-depth topic and product series, a continued dedication to high-quality, readable content, and perhaps even dipping our collective toe into the world of podcasts. As always, we ask you to hold us to the goals we set out with: to ensure each post inspires learning and reflection, and to publish content that brings you back for more. Please reach out to us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DAIGlobal) or [email](mailto:digital@dai.com) with feedback and hellos.

To that end, in case you missed it (#ICYMI), here’s our top-five most read blog posts of 2016. Short and sweet, this list features some of our best content themes such as Digital Insights and data. Please feel free to share with colleagues and friends, and we hope to see you on our [subscribers list](https://confirmsubscription.com/h/r/066AFBA15492935C) in 2017!

Happy reading, thank you for your support, and see you in 2017!
