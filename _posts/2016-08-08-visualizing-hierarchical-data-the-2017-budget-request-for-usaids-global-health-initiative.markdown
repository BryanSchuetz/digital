Budget data can be difficult to work with. The volume of data can be high, and the structures are almost always multi-layered, which makes it difficult to visualize on one page. But here at DAI we love data visualization and we are working with with advanced interactive visualization tools to help us see patterns in our data.

In this example, we take a budget data set and visualize it in a sunburst:

Sunbursts are a great way to see hierarchical data all at once and with a little JavaScript we can make them interactive too. Thanks to D3 this is all easier (and free).
