Visualizing budget data is traditionally pretty difficult. It is often high volume, multi-layered data which makes it hard to see all at once. But here at DAI we love data visualization and we are using D3 to help us with advanced interactive data visualizations.

Sunbursts are a great way to see hierarchical data all at once and with a little JavaScript we can make them interactive too
