I spent last week at the [ICT4D conference in Hyderabad](https://2017ict4dconference.sched.com/), a four-day feast of presentations, discussions, and panels on how international development organizations are using new technologies in the context of their work overseas. 

DAI hosted a trio of panels, the first on [mobile data collection](http://sched.co/AIQu) the second on [growing access to digital technologies](http://sched.co/AIRP) at the local level, and the third on [funding for social pitches](http://sched.co/AIUb), and attended at least a hundred panels between the four of us who went. My big takeaway was the importance of good digital design in ICT for international development, and thankfully there were a series of sessions that featured (either implicitly or explicitly) concrete lessons for designers. Here they are: 

1. Plan International’s [Bo Percival](https://2017ict4dconference.sched.com/bo_percival) presented a [solar-powered media backpack](https://vimeo.com/148598914), a rugged, portable, multimedia center with camera, projector and more, designed for remote settings. Modeling ICT4D best practices, Bo and the team are designing the backpack to be **_open source_**, so others can reuse, adapt, and improve their concept in other parts of the world. 

2. [Carolyn Florey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolynf/) from the Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) held a [feedback session](http://sched.co/AIR4) for DAIL’s upcoming Principles for Digital Development toolkit. Carolyn and DAIL are modeling the 9 Principles well by **_involving their intended users in the design_** of the toolkit. 

3. [Dr. Justin Greenough](https://2017ict4dconference.sched.com/speaker/jgreenough) featured [Vanu’s](http://www.vanu.com/) new solar-powered, briefcase-sized mobile network base station, the [CompactRAN](http://www.vanu.com/products/outdoor/compactran/). Vanu is piloting the tool in both Vermont and Rwanda, on hilly terrain that’s typically very difficult for traditional cell towers to cover due to the high cost of each tower. Vanu’s tool is being **_designed for scale_**, 

4. [Karl Lowe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlmlowe/) from Catholic Relief Services moderated a panel on the importance of [data privacy & security](http://sched.co/AE35) in international development programming. The panel highlighted the fact that while it’s easy to collect data from beneficiaries, we need only remember the Golden Rule—do unto others as you would have them to do you—to understand the importance of **_protecting the private information and security_** of the people we seek to help. 

5. [CGIAR](http://www.cgiar.org/), a global agricultural research partnership, hosted a launch event for their new [big data platform](http://bigdata.cgiar.org/), which is designed to bring organizations together to collect, analyze, and use massive amounts of agricultural data. The massive effort behind designing and launching the new platform emphasizes the need for international development practitioners of all stripes to **_be data drive_**. Given the distance at which we often operate from our beneficiaries, the importance of making data driven decisions takes on additional importance.  

6. Dalberg’s [Nirat Bhatnagar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nirat/?ppe=1) hosted a session on user-centric design for digital financial services, one of  Dalberg’s focus areas. Nirat discussed how **_understanding the ecosystem_** in which a designer’s intended users exist is key to whether those users will adopt a new tool or technology. 

7. [Vera Solutions’]( http://www.verasolutions.org/) [Aleksa Krolls](https://2017ict4dconference.sched.com/speaker/aleksa1) hosted a panel on the digital design process and what Vera has learned by executing it with more than 180 partner organizations around the world. Aleksa made the point that while Vera does design new technologies, their primary recommendation is to **_reuse and improve_** tools that already exist, like Salesforce which Vera often implements on behalf of clients. 

8. One of the most popular sessions at the entire conference was hosted by Dimagi’s [Anthony Connor](https://www.dimagi.com/team/usa/anthony-connor/), and highlighted various instances of successful implementation of Dimagi’s core product: [CommCare](https://www.dimagi.com/products/). CommCare is one of the best known and most widely used digital data collection platforms for a number of reasons, but one of the most important is that Dimagi understands the importance of **_being collaborative_**. They work closely with partners and clients throughout their design and implementation process. 

9. [Laeticia Klein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laeticia-klein-19070269/?ppe=1) presented on Transparency International Kenya’s new [corruption reporting systems](http://sched.co/AITw); one for blue collar corruption (white collar and one for. TI-Kenya’s systems are being developed in close consultation with the Kenyan Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, the Commission on Administrative Justice, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, and the National Cohesion & Integration Commission. Close consultation with partners throughout the design process is an important part of **_building for sustainability._**
