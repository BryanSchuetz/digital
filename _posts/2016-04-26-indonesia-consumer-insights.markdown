`A Consumer Insights survey at Rumah Kitab NGO in East Jakata`

Officially, unemployment in Indonesia [hovers around 6%]( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-unemployment-idUSKBN0P101D20150621). In a country of 250 million people, this amounts to some 15 million able bodied people who are searching for a job and can’t find one. Among youth (ages 16-24) the problem is even worse: official numbers peg [youth unemployment as high as 20%](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.1524.MA.ZS). With fully [half of Indonesia’s population under 30](http://theconversation.com/jobless-youth-raise-risk-of-indonesias-demographic-bonus-turning-into-disaster-50402), high youth unemployment bodes well neither for the country’s present nor its future. And these are just the official number; they don't include those who have given up looking. 

Youth who are not in school and not working are uniquely vulnerable to drug use, gang or extremist recruitment, and violence; they aren't actively developing productive life skills and they aren’t spurring economic activity in their communities. With this as context, DAI is working hard to gain deeper insights into the lives of these young people. Our goal is to find innovative ways to get them off the streets, into stable jobs, and to explore new opportunities for workforce development in a country with more than 88 million internet users, 93% of whom [access the internet via their phone](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/more-90-users-indonesia-access-net-their-smartphone-gfk).

In early April, DAI sent me to Indonesia to replicate some of the [mobile phone-related research I’ve been doing in Honduras](dai-global-digital.com/2016/04/13/honduras-consumer-insights.html), which focuses on understanding how at-risk young participate in information flows. 

Key questions include: 

* How do at-risk youth receive and share information in general? 
* Do they have mobile phones? If so, what kind? 
* What kinds of communication apps are most popular? 
* What kinds of games do they play?
* And much more...

We call this research Consumer Insights—“consumer” as in information consumer—and an early sample of our results is below. 

## Demographics

We conducted 107 face-to-face interviews with young people. About half were in Jakarta and half were in Semarang, a less urban city in the center of Java (the same island as Jakarta). They were roughly half females and half males, and the average age of our participants was 18.

## Sample Stats

The graphic below contains a few sample, binary results from our survey in Indonesia.
