[ICTforAg 2020](https://www.ictforag.com/) engaged a global audience of 1,502 participants across 26 sessions over the course of one day. The conference examined digital solutions in agriculture as a means of fostering resilience in the wake of disruptions, from climate-related disasters to COVID-19, and the intersections between them. Building on the momentum of this global event, the [Digital Frontiers](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df) team is supporting the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) [Bureau for Resilience and Food Security](https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/organization/bureaus/bureau-resilience-and-food-security) in the next ICTforAg conference.

As the COVID-19 pandemic persists, further threatening the food security and resilience of our most vulnerable communities, the Bureau of Resilience and Food Security is focused on scaling its impact in agriculture, resilience, nutrition, water security, sanitation, and hygiene. USAID seeks to build on the outcomes and learnings from ICTforAg 2020 as well as strengthen USAID staff’s digital literacy, forge strong cross-cutting and sectoral partnerships, and close the digital divide—as outlined by the USAID [Digital Strategy](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/15396/USAID_Digital_Strategy.pdf).

The next ICTforAg will be hosted virtually to continue encouraging global participation. The event will center around three overarching themes: **climate, digital inclusion, and locally led development**. These three themes will be woven throughout the day as we jointly explore how data, new technologies, and digital innovations are remaking food and water systems and value chains around the world, and how USAID can work with private sector actors and other development partners to accelerate their impact. Digital Frontiers requests proposals from organizations that have previously implemented large-scale virtual events within the international development field and/or agricultural sector. Connecting development actors, private sector firms, and stakeholders based in emerging markets will further USAID’s goal of expanding access to digital tools and technologies—so the Agency can better tackle the challenges to ending global hunger, undernutrition, and extreme poverty.
