Because who needs pharmaceutical drugs when you can just implant a shape-memory polymer with an embedded circuit to send neuro-signals to your faulty organs?

### 1) A direct line to your liver:
Bioelectronics is a field poised to change medicine. How do they work? Well, all you have to do is print a nano-scale electronic circuit onto a polymer material that is human-tissue-like enough that your body won’t trigger its natural defense mechanism of rejecting all foreign objects. Then you have to take the neuro-signal patterns from the brain and program the circuits to mimic those neuro-signals. Then, adhere the polymer directly to the malfunctioning tissue and it will deliver brain-like signals straight to the organ. That silly broken liver won’t know the difference!

### Simple, right?

### Yeah sounds simple enough, so what do these shape-memory-polymers look like?

### 2)	Like email vs. snail mail
Bioelectronics are better, more precise, and come with fewer side effects than our decades old (like 15 decades old) pharmaceutical-based system of drug delivery. Here are a few of the rock star pioneers making it happen: Dr. Moncef Slaoui was among the developers of the first malaria vaccine and has recently turned his attention to bioelectronics. Dr. Kate Rosenbluth is the CEO of Cala Health, a company working on developing novel therapies from recent discoveries in neuroscience. Dr. Walter Voit is a professor at UT Dallas and is devoted to growing a core of scientists specializing in this field.  I had the privilege of hearing these folks speak and it blew my mind – pay attention to what they’re up to, as that is where the sector is heading.
