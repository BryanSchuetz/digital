Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are rapidly evolving to include more complex and advanced tasks. As a result, the number of meaningful use cases relevant to the development sector are expanding and demonstrate significant potential to solve some of the world’s most prominent challenges.

In the agriculture sector, where increasing crop yields and improving resilience are key to economic development and poverty alleviation, AI applications can generate deeper insights and shorten feedback loops to support farmer decision making. For example, with a single photo captured on a smartphone, AI solutions can help farmers quickly identify crop infestation or disease and implement appropriate solutions. Further, as climate events become more extreme and unpredictable, farmers will require solutions to efficiently monitor crop health, manage water scarcity, and assess soil quality. [Smart automation tools](https://www.idrc.ca/sites/default/files/ai_en.pdf) that produce water reports and recommendations for specific localities present a boost to climate resilience efforts, along with substantial financial and logistical benefits for developing countries.

Despite these opportunities, the benefits of AI are predicted to be unevenly distributed, as [it is estimated](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b156e3bf2e6b10bb0788609/t/5e1f0a37e723f0468c1a77c8/1579092542334/AI\+and\+international\+Development_FNL.pdf) that China and North America will reap 70 percent of the total gains. This is in part due to the few dominant countries developing the required technology, as well as the various challenges to deploying AI in developing countries with weak technological infrastructure and limited data sources. To engage with AI and reap benefits for their respective agriculture sectors, countries must also have adequate access to digital devices, quality data, and human capacity.

Given AI and automation’s potential to transform the agrifood systems around the globe, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Bureau for Resilience and Food Security seeks to better understand their likely impacts in the agriculture development space as a means of promoting inclusive economic growth. 

## Seeking Industry Input
