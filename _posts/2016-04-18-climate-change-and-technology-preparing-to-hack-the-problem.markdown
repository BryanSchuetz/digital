On April 5, DAI hosted the first Forum on Technology for Climate Change in collaboration with the [Pontificia Universidad Javeriana](http://www.javeriana.edu.co/) in Bogota, Colombia and the Centro Ático – their on-campus technology and innovation hub. 

The Forum brought together more than 50 representatives of the public and private sector working on climate change and environmental management to lay the groundwork for the upcoming [NASA Space Apps Challenge in Colombia](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/locations/bogota-colombia) which will be held at the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana on April 22-24, 2016.  

The opening panel featured representatives from the Ministry of Technology, Information and Communications, the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainability, and the University; they addressed high level considerations around technologies for climate change decision making and underscored the Colombian government’s active role in empowering their citizens through technology and data.  Next, specific tools were presented. 

Several people from DAI attended the Forum.  We were thrilled to have Jim Boomgard, CEO from DAI, present.  Jim was in Colombia meeting with USAID and Embassy staff, accompanied by Maria Otero who is a Board member for DAI and with previous experience working for the State Department in Colombia.  Maria commented and Jim seconded that DAI is committed to supporting Colombia in its efforts to mitigate climate change and our support of this event and the Space Spps Challenge is a manifestation of that.  

DAI’s own Noemi Danao-Schroder, Director of Governance in the Global Region, moderated the event on April 5, 2016 and we recently had the chance to catch-up about what happened on the ground.

Q. What was the purpose of this event and who was on the initial panel?

Noemi:  The purpose of the event was to highlight technologies and innovations that Ministries and NGOs can use immediately to support climate change decision-making.  While we were there to really bring together these thought leaders, we also wanted to energize people around the NASA Space Apps Challenge.  We wanted to provide real-life examples of what could be generated in the Space Apps Challenge. 

The initial panel was María Carolina Hoyos Turbay - Viceminister for the Technology, Information and Communications; Father Luis Alfonso Castellanos Ramírez, Vice Rector at the Pontifica Universidad Javeriana, and Camila Rodriguez Vargas, Advisor at the Ministry of Environment and Sustainability.

Q. What is the NASA Space Apps Challenge?  

Noemi: The annual NASA Space Apps Challenge (https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/) is a 30 hour blitz of coding and product development – otherwise known as a hack-a-thon - that occurs simultaneously around the globe and uses NASA data and imagery to develop new solutions to pressing global challenges identified by NASA.  During the hack-a-thon, NASA satellite imagery, data sets, and tools are made available to students and other participants to create localized solutions.

Q. How will this event fuel the NASA Space Apps Challenge taking place 22-24 April in Bogota?

Noemi: One of the immediate benefits was to showcase actual outputs from previous iterations of the NASA SpaceAps Challenge.  Alejandro Solis presented the CoffeeCloud, a mobile app that connects farmers with coffee associations and extentionists to provide weather, good agricultural practices, and reference info on pests such as Coffee rust.  The CoffeeCloud was a finalist for the NASA SpaceApps Challenge of 2015 in Costa Rica, and was supported through the USAID Regional Climate Change Program in Central America that DAI works on with CATIE.  We were able to really take an abstract idea – such as designing a tech tool for farmers dealing with the environmental impacts on coffee plants – and show people a real-life example.  It was great to get beyond the abstract to actual solutions.   

Q. What were some of the other technologies that were presented? 
 
Noemi: Tito Muto from Conservación International presented TREMARCTOS COLOMBIA, which is a free, on-line tool that provides preliminary vulnerability screening and recommendations. http://www.tremarctoscolombia.org/
Luis Alfonso Ortega (Coordinator for Protected Areas and Climate Change at Fundación Ecohabitats) presented a toolkit to increase resilience to and reduce vulnerability around climate changes in rural areas, based on the latest technology and best practices tailored to local areas.

Q. What were some of the biggest takeaways from the Forum?

Noemi: For me, the biggest takeaways are that the Colombian government ministries are already developing concrete apps and tools to address specific concerns around climate change and vulnerability.  They are clearly committed to using tech where it makes sense to combat climate change. Not only that, they are committed to developing access points for the public. Hosting the NASA SpaceApps Challenge is one way to further these goals and generate enthusiasm from students, mentors, and judges and to crowd in new participants to create apps and tools that pull from international and national data sets simultaneously.
