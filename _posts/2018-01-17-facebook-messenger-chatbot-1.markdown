Last year I wrote a blog post called [I Made a Facebook Chatbot (And You Can, Too)](https://dai-global-digital.com/facebook-chatbot.html). Therein I laid out the case for chatbots as an outreach and engagement tool in international development, which--to recap--boils down to:
1. [1.3 billion active users](https://venturebeat.com/2017/09/14/facebook-messenger-passes-1-3-billion-monthly-active-users/), including a large and growing number of whom are in developing countries, as DAI's [Digital Insights](https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=digital-insights) work has highlighted. That's pretty hard to ignore. 
2. Low data usage puts the tool (and services riding on it) in a category of communication that's even cheaper than SMS in many instances, especially when users are connected to WiFi.
3. Natural language and conversation may be easier for some people to use than a GUI interface (to take it a step further, this might be an argument in favor of IVR, but I digress).
4. This one is new, but maybe the most relevant to you if you're reading this: they're easy to build!

I also featured [Siti](https://www.messenger.com/t/1276881939061378), a very simple Facebook Messenger chatbot bot I built using [Chatfuel](http://www.chatfuel.com), and gave readers some really bad directions for making their own bot. Since then I've upgraded my chatbot skills significantly: from Apprentice to Wizard, and I'm eager to share a bit of the magic with the world. 

So, here's how to make your own chatbot in five easy steps. Follow along and make your own; it's easier than 

## 1a. Have a Facebook account
Admittedly, only [2.06 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/) of the 7.6 billion people on Earth actually have a Facebook account so if you're among the 27% that do, you've cleared the first hurdle. 

## 1b. Make a Facebook Page


## 2.
