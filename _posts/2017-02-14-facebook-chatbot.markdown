I've been excited about using chatbots in our work since Facebook's [F8](https://www.fbf8.com/) Developer conference back in April of 2016, when they announced that [Messenger would support chatbots](https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/12/agents-on-messenger/).

Why is this a big deal for international development? The answer to that question has been one of the key takeaways of our [Digital Insights work in Indonesia](https://dai-global-digital.com/where-whatsapp-is-just-another-bbm-clone-digital-insights-indonesia.html), [Honduras](https://dai-global-digital.com/mobiles-in-central-america-digital-insights-honduras-part-2.html), and [Palestine](https://dai-global-digital.com/consumer-insights-palestine-e-governance-readiness.html): that Facebook and Messenger are hugely popular in the places we work and among the people that we support. In Indonesia, 77% of the people we interviewed said they used Facebook on their phone; in Palestine the number was *95%*. In Honduras, 80% of our respondents across urban and rural areas said they were Facebook users. If our projects want to reach people with messages and services, we have to meet them where they already are: on Facebook. 

Chatbots present an additional advantage as an outreach tool: they're generally lower bandwidth than loading a typical web page on your phone, and mobile data is expensive! According to [A4AI's 2015 Internet Affordability Report](http://a4ai.org/affordability-report/report/2015/#the_affordability_drivers_index_(adi)), people in some countries pay upwards of 40% of their income for mobile access! Every MB counts! 

During App-a-Thon 2016 we looked at how [Kik incorporates chatbots](https://dai-global-digital.com/appathon-2016-kik-for-development.html), but it's Facebook Messenger, with more than a billion users around the world, that presents the most opportunities to connect. Immediately after the F8 announcement, I looked for an FB Messenger chatbot builder with a simple user interface and easy integration with Facebook, but quickly realized that the options available at the time still required some knowledge of code. This immediately excluded me,
