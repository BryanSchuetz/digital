Indigenous peoples hold some of the world’s most ancient knowledge and sacred traditions while stewarding lands’ rich biodiversity. While the terms “ancient” and “traditional” are rarely seen in concert with “emerging tech trends,” there are communities around the world doing just that: finding creative ways to merge their ancient traditions with modern and even cutting-edge technologies.

While the COVID-19 pandemic brought disruption and adaption to indigenous communities as it did so many others, it didn’t take long for people to find ways to maintain social connectedness and communal healing virtually. A social media movement of [virtual powwows](https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/coronavirus-virtual-powwow-social-distance-1.5521785) started in the United States to “connect powwow dancers, drummers, vendors, and visitors from across North America.” In another example, Elders Elsey Gauthier and Francis Whiskeyjack took their in-person talking circles [online](https://www.ualberta.ca/folio/2020/05/elders-take-indigenous-cultural-teachings-online-to-support-u-of-a-students.html) to continue providing one-on-one counseling sessions for indigenous students through the University of Alberta’s First Peoples House. 

In this blog, I will showcase how indigenous North Americans integrate community-building, storytelling, and art creation with 21st-century technologies for cultural preservation, advocacy, healing, and economic empowerment, and the link to international development.

## Sharing Stories of Truth and Trauma

Indigenous and First Nations communities in North America have been using digital avenues such as podcasts and social media for storytelling and advocacy related to the horrors and abuse that have afflicted their communities for generations. Investigative podcast series embrace the true crime trend to recount stories of crime and trauma experienced by indigenous communities. In [*Missing & Murdered*](https://www.cbc.ca/mediacentre/program/missing-and-murdered), Connie Walker, a Cree journalist from Okanese First Nation, tells the stories of Alberta Williams and Cleo Nicotine Semaganis, shedding light on the [staggering number](https://airc.ucsc.edu/resources/mmiwg.html) of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls (“MMIWG”). In *[Stolen](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/stolen)*, she exposes the harsh realities of the abuse and subsequent intergenerational trauma that resulted from government policies around [residential schools](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/08/10/residential-schools-were-key-tool-americas-long-history-native-genocide/) in North America throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Another podcast, *[This Land](https://crooked.com/podcast-series/this-land/)*, explains the history of the current Indian Child Welfare Act ([ICWA](https://www.nicwa.org/about-icwa/)), which protects indigenous child custody and welfare, and how political challenges to ICWA threaten the broader right to tribal lands. ICWA advocates and indigenous influencers also use platforms such as Instagram to share updates and advocacy around this and other issues in their communities.

## Decolonizing the Internet and Facilitating Financial Freedom

In Canada, the [400 Drums](https://www.400drums.com/) [Web3](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/web3-and-nfts-explained) project aims to economically empower indigenous populations while sharing cultural traditions and bringing physical artifacts into the digital space. The project hosts a catalog of more than 400 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) derived from drums handcrafted by lead artist David Fierro of the Okanagan Nation, which he then digitally enhances for [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) release. The program helps indigenous elders, artists, and language speakers use cutting-edge digital technology to achieve financial freedom. NFTs are unique digital codes using blockchain technology that allow artists to control how their [work is used](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2022/08/19/web3-nfts-and-the-future-of-art/?sh=69cfc2eb1e05) and establish favorable payment terms. Through this proof-of-concept platform, artists can sell digital versions of their original works and control who gets credit and payment for the work indefinitely, regardless of how many times the item is resold. Art that can’t be copied is particularly appealing to indigenous artists, whose works are frequently replicated and sold without permission. Funds from 400 Drums NFTs support a variety of social, environmental and community programs, such as teaching indigenous youth the ancient physical craft of drum making. Additionally, the physical drums Fierro creates can still be gifted and kept within the community, where selling such sacred pieces of art is a crime.

By this Web3 proof-of-concept, people are taking control of their own data, intellectual property, and monetary systems. 400 Drums Creative Director Tamara Goddard of Saulteau First Nation describes the decentralized opportunity to enter the Web3 space as a way of decolonizing the internet. As quoted in the [Daily Hive](https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/400-drums-indigenous-nfts), Goddard says, “It’s time we blazed our own trail for economic reconciliation and cultural revitalization.” Indigenous cultures have persisted for generations, adapting as the world evolves. 400 Drums’ revolutionary economic model is another way communities are adapting to current times, saving space for authentic indigenous products in Web3 to preserve and share indigenous culture and teachings for future generations of indigenous youth and other cultures alike.

## Applications in International Development

As indigenous communities use modern technology to preserve, share, and exert control over their stories, how can international development practitioners be mindful to not only [do no harm](https://www.cdacollaborative.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Do-No-Harm-A-Brief-Introduction-from-CDA.pdf), but benefit and empower these historically underserved communities through digital solutions? 

Last year, I spoke with a religious community leader from a country in the Pacific Islands about the challenges and opportunities related to connectivity and ICT among diverse, remote, and indigenous populations in the region. As communal people, he emphasized the importance of ICT to Pacific Island populations—especially amid COVID-19 lockdowns—to foster relationships and community. He also highlighted its further potential to support income-generating e-commerce opportunities and cultural preservation for indigenous languages, traditions, and arts. At the same time, he expressed concern that individuals’ reliance on devices such as smartphones may detract from in-person family and community communication, potentially eroding their social matrix and cultural identity. When proposing a digital literacy or donor-funded program in this context, he stressed the importance of considering cultural values and priorities for successful implementation. In the Pacific Islands, this includes principles like respectful engagement, consensus-building, the value of silence, and respect for the land. There are a number of donors and international organizations supporting digital development in this context, such as the International Centre for Democratic Partnerships (ICDP) Pacific Connect project that has supported groups such as Tonga Women in ICT on digital and virtual [training initiatives](https://www.icdp.com.au/2020/12/01/tonga-women-in-ict-thriving-in-the-new-normal/) around topics such as coding, storytelling and digital media, and digital agriculture. 

Another example in international development can be found within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s partnership with Microsoft through the Airband initiative. Implemented through DAI’s [Digital Frontiers](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df) program, this initiative utilizes public-private collaboration to close the gender digital divide for remote and rural populations. In Guatemala, program partner New Sun Road launched an initiative to improve connectivity in the Alta Verapaz region by building digital community centers and developing a digital literacy training curriculum targeting [indigenous women](https://www.digitalfrontiersdai.com/resources/bridging-the-gender-digital-divide-for-guatemalan-indigenous-women/). From April to June alone, women’s leadership committees offered 2,316 services to their communities through the digital community centers, and the centers saw an 81 percent average increase in revenue over the prior quarter.

As we support people and projects worldwide in areas such as digital literacy, cyber safety, and e-commerce, let’s be mindful that literacy comes in many forms (i.e., linguistic, iconographic, olfactory, gustatory, sartorial, and spiritual—as explained in Araba Sapara-Grant’s Digital@DAI blog post, [Digital Literacy Series: Closing the Gap for Semi-Literate and Illiterate Populations](https://dai-global-digital.com/digital-literacy-series-closing-the-gap-for-semi-literate-and-illiterate-populations.html)). When designing with the user (frequent readers will be familiar with this [Principle of Digital Development](https://digitalprinciples.org/)), consider the user’s cultural values, traditions, norms, and existing means of communication and literacy. With this intention, we can actively support target communities with tools or practices most likely to be adopted, owned, and sustained in the long term.
