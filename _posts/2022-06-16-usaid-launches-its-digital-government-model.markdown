In 2021, as people around the world—and their governments—were grappling with a rapid transition to digital technology, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) [Digital Frontiers](https://www.digitalfrontiersdai.com/) project began working with the Technology Division of USAID’s Innovation, Technology, and Research (ITR/T) Hub to create a conceptual model of digital government, or e-government. That model is now [live](https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/digital-government-model) and available to the public.

Using existing literature as well as USAID’s own experience as a starting point, the model produces a clear conceptual understanding of various elements of digital government and the risks of digitizing systems, processes, and tools at a rapid pace. ITR/T also consulted with USAID’s Center for Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance (DRG Center) in developing the model. The diagram above summarizes the components.
