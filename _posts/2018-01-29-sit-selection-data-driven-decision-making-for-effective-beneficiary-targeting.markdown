Recently while on assignment in Haiti, a project manager for a local agricultural development project a asked my team why we weren't targeting a specific set of rural communities. According to him, those communities are the ones that could really benefit from the type of work that we were doing. While we had good reason to work where we were working, the question stuck: ***How can we be certain that we are targeting the right communities with our work? ***You're a project looking to reduce violence in schools in Honduras - Which specific schools should you prioritize given that you can't work across all of them? You're a governance-strengthening project in Kosovo - Which localities should you work in where you can be most effective? Most importantly, what does a decision-making process based in evidence and aligned with donor priorities look like?

In an attempt to make sure that we are consistently able to answer these questions, we have developed a data driven methodology to targeting beneficiaries that we have called Site Selection. This structured process provides projects with up-front guidance on decision making, developing and applying a set of criteria for assessing a range of potential intervention sites or beneficiaries, enabling them to make evidence-based decisions and build a strong case for targeted interventions, and to date we have employed the Site Selection process successfully from Kosovo to Honduras to Iraq.

# The Process:

1. ***Stakeholder Consultation and Criteria Formulation:***
   At the earliest possible stage, we consult with key project staff and client donor representatives to create a unified vision for priorities with regards to targeting beneficiaries. Together we develop a beneficiary profile from which priorities can be derived, after which we develop clear and measurable selection criteria based on the desired impact of the project.

2. ***Data Surveying and Collection***
   With a beneficiary profile and a set of measurable criteria at hand, we then work with projects to identify available datasets, or curate new ones, from which evidence of suitability of individual beneficiaries or geographic locations can be drawn. These can include national level data such as school matriculation rates, or highly localized data such as sector crime rates in one municipality. Where necessary, we design data collection plans to supplement what is already available.

3. ***Weighting and Scoring***
   The next stage in the site selection process involves crunching the numbers: 1) determining a scoring system that allows for beneficiary or site ranking according to the criteria set out, 2) applying this scoring system to the data collected in the second step, 3) designing a weighting system to build flexibility into the system, allowing projects to adaptively apply weighting according to shifting priorities, and 4) developing an interactive visual to allow the project to apply weights dynamically and prioritize beneficiaries.

## Case Study: Prioritizing Iraqi Provinces for Improved Governance and Service Delivery

In December of 2017, one of our newest projects - the Iraq Governance and Performance Accountability (IGPA) project - had collected a host of data that they wanted to use to weigh options concerning which Iraqi provinces would be considered priorities for project investments. The vision was to provide the local client mission with a flexible platform for weighing priorities againts one another to identify a set of high priority provinces where the project will subsequently focus resources. The idea was to allow a user of the developed platform to adjust a variable weighting system for a set of criteria including:

1. Citizen Participation

2. Financial Resilience

3. Political Will

4. Service Delivery

Each of these individual criteria required that the project team gathered datasets that allow for the quantification of that particular criterion. For example "Number of Active Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)" and "CSO's headed by women" as proxies for Citizen Participation, or "Operating Budget"  and "Capital Investment Budget" for Financial Resilience.

Aggregating the data and calculating a final score based on a distribution of variable weights (indicating importance) for each Iraqi province allows the site selection platform's user to draw insight out of the collected data, helping him or her to make prioritization decisions that are equally based on evidence as embodied by the datasets, and thematic priority as embodied by the weights distributed by the user.
