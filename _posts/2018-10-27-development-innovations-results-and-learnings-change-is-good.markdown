Innovation is a nebulous term. But you  already knew that. It’s even more nebulous in donor-funded development, where the flexible, instinctive nature of innovation often seems to clash with the structured, accountability focused logical frameworks of donor-funded projects. In development programming, we don’t tend to approach change constructively. We usually see changing course as the failure of the old course rather than a successful manifestation of learning. But can we do things differently and still provide tangible outcomes? Is it possible for us to approach our work as equal parts learning and doing? Can the learning inform our doing in real time? The answer is yes – under the right conditions.

In April this year I traveled to Cambodia as part of a team to conduct a research and learning exercise for DAI’s [Development Innovations (DI)](https://www.development-innovations.org/) project – a project focused on empowering Cambodia’s Civil Society and Social Entrepreneurs with technology to tackle local development challenges. Our report found that Development Innovations is proving that with the right staff, management approach, and trust from donors, development practitioners can not only BE innovative, but inspire sustainable innovation. Here are a few of the report’s main insights:

1. **Building Communities - Playing a facilitator’s role**
   Yes, like many projects, DI funded dozens of grants to support initiatives by Cambodian organizations. But far more impactful than the disbursed funds is the role that DI has played as a facilitator and leader, bringing together actors in civil society, social entrepreneurship, tech and beyond to create a community where there previously was none. It is out of this fledgling community, fostered by DI, that new leaders and initiatives have grown and taken on a life of their own.\

2. **Managing Adaptively – Focusing and improving programming**
   Learning isn’t impactful if it is isn’t applied. If a particular activity isn’t working well, or even worse – isn’t valued by beneficiaries, why continue it? Why not reinvest resources away from wasteful activities and towards promising ones? By committing to managing adaptively and applying lessons as they are being learned, DI has been able to hone in on the services that have proved truly impactful and expand upon those.\

3. **Replicable Models - Strategically investing in leadership and mentorship**
   One of the major challenges that development projects (including DI) face is ensuring the sustainability of the project’s work. Often the focus tends to be on handing over specific initiatives to new owners. However our research determined that this is an approach fraught with challenges and one that may be flawed conceptually. A more robust strategy would be to invest strategically in people, organizations, and communities that have proven already to be aligned with your vision and operating model, and exhibit the initiative and leadership necessary to carry that vision and model forward. Maybe the specific training program the project developed will not continue past project end, but a training institution you support will be equipped find new capacity building needs based on a listening to needs of beneficiaries.

It will always be a nebulous term, but taking a different approach to how we as development practitioners view change – that just might be innovation. The full Results and Learning Review can be found here.
