This month I’ve been reflecting on all that has happened since this time last year, back when we were still blissfully unaware of what 2020 had in store. I won’t belabor the obstacles the world has faced since then. However, I do want to share some important concepts for colleagues who, like myself not so long ago, may be early in their international development-to-digital development journey. Below are some important topics – many on which my tech savvy colleagues and others have written extensively (so check out links embedded throughout) – that can be applied across our development projects and field work. Consider this the sophomore edition of the “Digital Development for Newbies” series, but if you’re brand new to this topic I encourage you to start with Part 1: The Basics.

## Increased Digitalization = Increased Vulnerability

Stakeholders across the international development and humanitarian sectors continue to show increased interest in digitization (converting something to a digital format) and digitalization (converting processes or offline systems to usage of digital technologies). We’ve seen this from our clients, government counterparts and end users. While this can offer efficiency and transparency, it is critical to note that this comes increased cybersecurity risks. You may be tired of being told to change your password or to add a second layer of authentication, but these tips are more important now than ever before. While the term may conjure images of expert computer coders and hackers, “cybersecurity” has become a shared duty. We each play a key role in not only protecting our own personal data, but also the systems and data of our colleagues and project beneficiaries.

Cybersecurity should not be thought of as an emergency intervention added when a need is identified. Rather, it should be “baked in” to project design from the start, *before* vulnerabilities are exposed.

**Application:** As international development professionals, let’s consider privacy and cybersecurity when writing proposals, training staff during project start-up, and throughout activity implementation (such as if the Government of Kosovo asks for support to [implement an electronic procurement system](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/kosovo-transparent-effective-and-accountable-municipalities-team) or Central American farmers seek a [mobile app that shares information on climate patterns](https://assetify-dai.com/pdfs/digital-coffee-cloud-eng.pdf) and crop diseases). Though technology continues to advance rapidly, regulation to govern privacy and security lags far behind. As we introduce cutting-edge tools in our programming, consider how to educate users on safe practices and the risks associated with these tools.

## Let’s Acknowledge and Confront the Digital Divide

Now more than ever, there is a sense that \*everyone \*is online. However, there remain [significant spreads in digital access and literacy across populations](https://www.governing.com/now/Its-2020-Why-Is-the-Digital-Divide-Still-with-Us.html) based on myriad factors such as age, gender, income, urban versus rural, and race. Communities and groups that are already marginalized risk becoming further disadvantaged in the [mid-digital age](https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/23/the-three-ages-of-digital/). So what role can development and tech professionals alike play to narrow rather than close the [digital divide](https://dai-global-digital.com/covid-19-the-importance-of-understanding-digital-divides-during-the-pandemic-response.html)? Firstly, in our digital projects and programming we can acknowledge this divide and design interventions to bridge this gap, supporting the excluded populations to gaining connectivity and digital literacy skills. Secondly, for any projects – whether focused on health, agriculture, or supporting entrepreneurs – we can be intentional in designing our activities, outreach and data collection in a way that is inclusive of folks across this divide.

**Application:** When designing activities, ask your team: What audience might you miss by only pushing out WASH behavior change campaigns via social media? What data might you omit if only conducting a small business market survey via email? What population will miss out on vaccinations if appointments can only be made via website?

## Disinformation is an Increasing Threat to Global Governance and Public Health

Digital technologies are rapidly expanding the reach and impact of misinformation (unknowingly incorrect information) and disinformation (incorrect information spread with intention to deceive) online. Combatting mis- and disinformation has become an increasing area of concern in the U.S. as well as abroad, particularly common in the spread of false information related to politics and [COVID-19](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/covid19-vaccine.html) but also prevalent in other topics such as climate change and racial justice.

How does this affect our work in international development? We are now seeing donors fund standalone programs that focus on this topic, such as by USAID to [mitigate Kremlin manipulation of information in Georgia](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/oct-8-2020-usaid-launches-innovative-program-counter-disinformation-georgia) and by UK Aid (now “FCDO”) to tackle the spread of [false information related to COVID-19](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-aid-to-tackle-global-spread-of-coronavirus-fake-news) in Southeast Asia and Africa.

**Application:** The spread of false information is an increasingly important element to consider in any governance or public health program. Implementers of more traditional development activities such as those supporting free and transparent elections, conflict mitigation and stabilization, WASH campaigns and vaccination roll-outs should consider activities to increase community media literacy and combat the spread of mis- and disinformation, especially via the most rapid (i.e. online) channels.

## Technology Can be Racist

Institutional racism has gained increased and long overdue attention in 2020. It should be no surprise that digital tools designed by humans can likewise be subject to the known and unknown biases of the individuals who make up the design team, serve as test users, and provide training data. My colleague recently wrote about an infuriating example of such [bias in pulse oximeters](https://dai-global-digital.com/racist-hardware-and-what-to-do-about-it.html) that give misleading and potentially fatal diagnostic readings to black patients. Furthermore, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) [algorithms can also show racial bias](https://dai-global-digital.com/algorithms-in-development.html?utm_source=related-box), particularly when the machines are trained on homogenous data. This problem is particularly profound as it relates to [facial recognition software](https://www.utdallas.edu/news/science-technology/racial-bias-facial-recognition-2020/). Such biases underscore the fact that digital tools do not necessarily work the same across all geographic contexts and for all populations.

**Application:** To avoid racism (and general irrelevance), before introducing a flashy app developed in Silicon Valley to community health workers in Ethiopia, ask the developers a few questions: Was the app designed to address this particular problem (or was it designed for the sake of design and now in search of a market)? Has this app ever been tested with the target user population? In the case of ML technology, is the diversity of training data representative of the target community you hope to serve? Do you have insights that indicate users would be receptive to this type of technology?
