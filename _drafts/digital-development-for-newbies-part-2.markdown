This month I’ve been reflecting on all that has happened since this time last year, back when we were still blissfully unaware of what 2020 had in store. I won’t belabor the obstacles the world has faced since then. However, I do want to share some important concepts for colleagues who, like myself not so long ago, may be early in their international development-to-digital development journey. Below are some important topics – many on which my tech savvy colleagues and others have written extensively (so check out links embedded throughout) – that can be applied across our development projects and field work. Consider this the sophomore edition of the “Digital Development for Newbies” series, but if you’re brand new to this topic I encourage you to start with Part 1: The Basics.

## Increased Digitalization = Increased Vulnerability

Stakeholders across the international development and humanitarian sectors continue to show increased interest in digitization (converting something to a digital format) and digitalization (converting processes or offline systems to usage of digital technologies). We’ve seen this from our clients, government counterparts and end users. While this can offer efficiency and transparency, it is critical to note that this comes increased cybersecurity risks. You may be tired of being told to change your password or to add a second layer of authentication, but these tips are more important now than ever before. While the term may conjure images of expert computer coders and hackers, “cybersecurity” has become a shared duty. We each play a key role in not only protecting our own personal data, but also the systems and data of our colleagues and project beneficiaries.

Cybersecurity should not be thought of as an emergency intervention added when a need is identified. Rather, it should be “baked in” to project design from the start, *before* vulnerabilities are exposed.

**Application:** As international development professionals, let’s consider privacy and cybersecurity when writing proposals, training staff during project start-up, and throughout activity implementation (such as if the Government of Kosovo asks for support to [implement an electronic procurement system](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/kosovo-transparent-effective-and-accountable-municipalities-team) or Central American farmers seek a [mobile app that shares information on climate patterns](https://assetify-dai.com/pdfs/digital-coffee-cloud-eng.pdf) and crop diseases). Though technology continues to advance rapidly, regulation to govern privacy and security lags far behind. As we introduce cutting-edge tools in our programming, consider how to educate users on safe practices and the risks associated with these tools.
