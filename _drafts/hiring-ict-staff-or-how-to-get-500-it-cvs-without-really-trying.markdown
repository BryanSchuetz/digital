Kabul, 2016. I'd been here before: a cold cup of Nescafe and stack of overly-formatted CVs on the table next to me, an over-worked HR officer slow-blinking at me from across the room in subtle despair. Of the 35 CVs in the stack, culled from hundreds submitted online, only two had any mention of ICT experience - the rest were full of network engineering degrees, Oracle and Microsoft certifications, and years and years of experience managing IT networks and project systems. If I had been looking to hire IT staff, I would have been spoiled for options; but I wasn't. I was trying to hire an ICT Officer, and it was almost impossible. Just as it had been in Cambodia, and Jordan, and Senegal. 

## What is the difference between IT and ICT anyway?
