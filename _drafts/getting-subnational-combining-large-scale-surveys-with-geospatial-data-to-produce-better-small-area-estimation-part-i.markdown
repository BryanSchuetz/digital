Collecting granular location data on key socioeconomic indicators for strategic planning is an increasingly important topic in international development. Given the limitations of national-level data, many analysts and policymakers now focus on obtaining subnational data to identify pockets of poverty in a country, to select priority sites for poverty alleviation programs, to establish subnational benchmarks for monitoring and evaluation purposes, and to cross validate data collected by country governments on key indicators such as child mortality rates or basic literacy rates.

The ambitious standards set for the Sustainable Development Goals were intended to be accompanied by a "data revolution" in low and middle-income countries, producing high-quality subnational data. This data has not been generated by central statistical agencies collecting greater quantities of administrative data, as previously thought, but rather through methodological and technological advances in small area estimation (SAE) methods. Using these models has become a viable option through big data techniques, such as Bayesian multilevel statistical models that require heavier computation, and wider availability of other forms of data that can be linked to surveys, such as geospatial and social media data. As a result, large scale surveys—such as the Demographic and Health Survey, Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, and Living Standards Measurement Survey—have used these analytical techniques to provide key socioeconomic indicators at more granular levels.

This article aims to provide an overview of these methods and their advances. Part I highlights progress made in survey data analysis to produce more precise subnational estimates. We detail the the initial use of these methods in poverty mapping at the World Bank and their increased relevance to other areas, such as public opinion and polling research. Building on our prior posts on the [innovative uses of GIS data](https://dai-global-digital.com/gis-data-availability-and-applicability.html?utm_source=related-box), Part 2 focuses on the promises and challenges of linking socioeconomic and geospatial data for subnational estimation.

A later article will showcase how the Center for Acceleration (CDA) team has employed these methods to inform strategy and insights in our own work.

## Advances in Survey Research and SAE Methods

SAE refers to a set of statistical methods used for making more accurate indirect estimates when the subsample size of surveys is insufficiently large to produce precise direct estimates for the regional areas under examination. These imply the use of statistical models that link survey data to larger datasets, such as administrative or census data, from which they borrow common variables to “fill in the blanks” on the variable of interest for the area in question.

These [methods have been in use for over 40 years](https://doi.org/10.1080%2F01621459.1979.10482505), although their principal use in the international development space began with the World Bank’s poverty mapping based on the [ELL model](https://are.berkeley.edu/\~ligon/Teaching/ARE251/elbers-etal03.pdf) in the early 2000’s. This typically involves employing a two-level (survey cluster and household) nested error regression model to estimate income or expenditure at the household level using survey data. These estimates are then linked to create predicted values at the household level for all census tracts, utilizing the same set of covariates that were applied in the regression model. Finally, the estimates are aggregated upwards to the relevant political or administrative level units in question for analysis. The success of this method led to the development of the [PovMap](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/povmap-global-subnational-infant-mortality-rates-v2-01/maps) software to provide subnational poverty estimates to analysts, policymakers and other key practitioners. The development of this software also led the World Bank to offer training and support to many statistical agencies to foster greater use of this method.

Methodological advances in statistical modeling, particularly the development of the [MR model](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/33819) which conditions on the survey sample data to produce simulated estimates of welfare, has made these estimates more precise. Alongside this, increased use of SAE methods has also led to their use for assessing other key indicators beyond poverty or welfare, including health outcomes, employment rates, and public opinion related questions. Specifically, the use of [multi-level regression with poststratification (MRP),](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/\~gelman/research/unpublished/MRT(1).pdf) a similar multilevel modeling method to the ones mentioned above, has been used by survey researchers and political scientists for evaluating public opinion and even forecasting elections. Most notably, the polling firm YouGov used the method to [accurately predict the result in 93% of all constituencies in the 2017 UK parliamentary elections](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2134144-how-yougovs-experimental-poll-correctly-called-the-uk-election/#ixzz63vulf5ZP). This has also enabled one particularly important achievement for survey researchers: shifting to less expensive data collection modes, such as online survey panels or SMS messages. This outcome is simplified by the ability to collect a larger overall number of responses and correct non-representative samples through the use of poststratification based on information available in the auxiliary data. A prime example of this is the [accurate predictions of state-level outcomes in the United States for the 2016 national election by asking X-Box users who they planned to vote for](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/forecasting-with-nonrepresentative-polls.pdf). These methods have been brought into the international development realm: most recently, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Mathematica, and Geopoll carried out an SMS survey in Uganda [to estimate financial inclusion](https://www.mathematica.org/download-media?MediaItemId=%7B4DB446CF-FC74-4C9D-8A38-466A4DCA8DC9%7D) using a version of MRP.

## The Promises of Linking Geospatial and Socioeconomic Data for Small Area Estimation

Another recent important advance has come from linking geospatial data with household surveys to improve the prediction of estimates. Some examples of geospatial data include the usage of environmental factors, such as total rainfall per year or average monthly temperatures, agricultural variables such as growing season length, or infrastructure-based information such as nightlight intensity. The potential for using this information is massive, particularly to fill the gap in countries that do not have frequent large-scale surveys or a recently conducted  census, which is the case in many low and middle-income countries (see Table 1) and is an especially common occurrence in fragile states.

Does geospatial data provide useful information for small area estimation? The largest base of evidence thus far has been accumulated by USAID's Demographic and Health Surveys by linking key geospatial information to enumeration areas for their surveys. In addition, it has produced a [significant body of research reports](https://dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-search.cfm?type=45) on the incorporation of geospatial information to foresee various socioeconomic and health outcomes.
