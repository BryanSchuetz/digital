Southeast Asia is one of the world’s fastest growing regions for digital connectivity. [Thai people, for example, spend on average nine hours a day using the internet on their mobile phones.](https://www.nationthailand.com/news/30382735) That's the second-highest in the world! And 95 percent of all Thais connected to the internet are on Facebook.

We have all heard about some of the dangers that come with using social media—misinformation, privacy concerns, and cyber bullying, just to name a few. But people in Thailand, like many places around the world, are still very invested in social media platforms, despite the challenges. So how might we turn this challenge into an opportunity?

USAID and DAI are collaborating with Facebook Thailand, Love Frankie, a local social change agency, and 400 university students around the country in the [Wai Kid Digital Challenge](https://www.usaid.gov/asia-regional/press-releases/feb-9-2021-united-states-promotes-digital-literacy-thailand) to demystify digital safety and citizenship and educate the Thai public about positive online communication, online identity and security, news literacy, and critical thinking through creative videos.

Here are five fresh tips that we have learned from the Challenge so far to make sure your next digital safety activity delivers results.

## 1. Design for Human First

We know that we should change our passwords often, use a VPN, and watch out for fake news, but do we care enough to really do these things all the time?\

The challenge with our target audience, the Thai public, is usually not the lack of technical capabilities. It’s that they think these cyberthreats would never affect them—until they actually get hacked, cyberbullied, or believe a fake news article, and then it’s too late.
With this in mind, we designed the Challenge with an emphasis on a modified Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach, so that students can craft creative videos about digital safety and citizenship that resonate with their identified target audience in an engaging manner. However, while we taught the students HCD, we didn’t apply it enough ourselves—at first.\

We initially planned to host in-person bootcamps at six different universities to maximize our engagements with the students, and design based on their needs. Then a wave of COVID-19 virus hit us just two weeks before the in-person bootcamps were scheduled to start. We were forced to go 100 percent virtual in a short amount of time.


In our first virtual session, we used lots of text to communicate to the participants about digital safety. Too much text! We also tried one-hour long videos, which were similarly unpalatable. The outcome was that students did not engage enough with the materials provided.\

So, we looked at the data and asked our end users—the participants—how we could do better. Based on that feedback, we adapted the way we now interact with our students. Instead of long videos and long texts, we started using private Facebook groups, live interactive Zoom sessions, bite-sized infographics, short TikTok-style videos, Facebook events, quizzes, polls, and lots of GIFs.

With these new approaches, participants of the program were much more responsive to our messages and started to get more involved with the program activities. Collaboration, Learning, and Adaption really works!
Make sure to understand how your audience engages with the technology—and design your activities with that in mind. When you can, design it with them!

## 2. Bring Different Perspectives

We can’t be experts in everything, but we can convene the right people to ensure we hear different perspectives. This gives us the opportunity to cross-pollinate with stakeholders in different fields in order to co-create an activity together.

In our case, USAID Regional Development Mission for Asia (RDMA) and the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok helped spread the message about the importance of digital safety to the public in Thailand and the international community. This lent credibility and emphasized the importance of the students’ input. In addition, Facebook Thailand staff provided their time and expertise to the students on the topic of digital citizenship and provided sessions on how to generate creative mobile content so that the students can share their knowledge with the Thai public.

Which other groups have the expertise to convey messages creatively that lead to behavior change? Influencers. So, we got them to provide masterclasses in a month-long virtual bootcamp. Examples include:

· [Pailin Wedel](https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/1705504/defeating-death), an **award-winning Thai-American journalist and filmmaker** who produced the Hope Frozen documentary on Netflix, shared tips on storyboarding.

· [Bbinko](https://www.instagram.com/bbinko/), **illustrator-influencer** with almost 500,000 followers in Instagram, shared her experiences in creating high-impact content and pitching.

· [Toffie](https://www.facebook.com/toffieisitsupport), **e-sport and tech vlogger, **provided feedback on students’ video pitches.

· Leading experts on **design thinking** helped students craft their key messages for the right target audience, and a **creative psychologist** worked with the students on effective storytelling.

Bringing many people together is never without its own set of challenges—aligning on shared objectives, speaking with one voice to our participants, and the logistical aspects to make this happen is always tough—however, it’s worth the effort!

~By involving stakeholders from a variety of fields, the youth gain fresh perspectives on the topic of digital safety (which makes it cool), and the partners involved are energized by interacting with youth, creating more buy-in for the activity goals.~
