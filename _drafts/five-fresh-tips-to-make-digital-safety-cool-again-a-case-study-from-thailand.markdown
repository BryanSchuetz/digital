Southeast Asia is one of the world’s fastest growing regions for digital connectivity. [Thai people, for example, spend on average nine hours a day using the internet on their mobile phones.](https://www.nationthailand.com/news/30382735) That's the second-highest in the world! And 95 percent of all Thais connected to the internet are on Facebook.

We have all heard about some of the dangers that come with using social media—misinformation, privacy concerns, and cyber bullying, just to name a few. But people in Thailand, like many places around the world, are still very invested in social media platforms, despite the challenges. So how might we turn this challenge into an opportunity?

USAID and DAI are collaborating with Facebook Thailand, Love Frankie, a local social change agency, and 400 university students around the country in the [Wai Kid Digital Challenge](https://www.usaid.gov/asia-regional/press-releases/feb-9-2021-united-states-promotes-digital-literacy-thailand) to demystify digital safety and citizenship and educate the Thai public about positive online communication, online identity and security, news literacy, and critical thinking through creative videos.

Here are five fresh tips that we have learned from the Challenge so far to make sure your next digital safety activity delivers results.

## 1. Design for Human First

We know that we should change our passwords often, use a VPN, and watch out for fake news, but do we care enough to really do these things all the time?

The challenge with our target audience, the Thai public, is usually not the lack of technical capabilities. It’s that they think these cyberthreats will never affect them—until they actually get hacked, cyberbullied, or believe a fake news article, and then it’s too late.

With this in mind, we designed the Challenge with an emphasis on a modified Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach, so that students can craft creative videos about digital safety and citizenship that resonate with their identified target audience in an engaging manner. However, while we taught the students HCD, we didn’t apply it enough ourselves—at first.

We initially planned to host in-person bootcamps at six different universities to maximize our engagements with the students, and design based on their needs. Then a wave of COVID-19 hit us just two weeks before the in-person bootcamps were scheduled to start. We were forced to go 100 percent virtual in a short amount of time.

In our first virtual session, we used lots of text to communicate to the participants about digital safety. Too much text! We also tried one-hour long videos, which were similarly unpalatable. The outcome was that students did not engage enough with the materials provided.

So, we looked at the data and asked our end users—the participants—how we could do better. Based on that feedback, we adapted the way we now interact with our students. Instead of long videos and long texts, we started using private Facebook groups, live interactive Zoom sessions, bite-sized infographics, short TikTok-style videos, Facebook events, quizzes, polls, and lots of GIFs.

With these new approaches, participants of the program were much more responsive to our messages and started to get more involved with the program activities. Collaboration, Learning, and Adaption really works!

**Main Takeaway: **Make sure to understand how your audience engages with the technology and design your activities with that in mind. When you can, design it with them!

## 2. Bring Different Perspectives

We can’t be experts in everything, but we can convene the right people to ensure we hear different perspectives. This gives us the opportunity to cross-pollinate with stakeholders in different fields in order to co-create an activity together.

In our case, USAID's Regional Development Mission for Asia (RDMA) and the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok helped spread the message about the importance of digital safety to the public in Thailand and the international community. This lent credibility and emphasized the importance of the students’ input. In addition, Facebook Thailand staff provided their time and expertise to the students on the topic of digital citizenship and provided sessions on how to generate creative mobile content so that the students can share their knowledge with the Thai public.

Which other groups have the expertise to convey messages creatively that lead to behavior change? Influencers. So, we got them to provide masterclasses in a month-long virtual bootcamp. Examples include:

* [Pailin Wedel](https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/social-and-lifestyle/1705504/defeating-death), an **award-winning Thai-American journalist and filmmaker** who produced the Hope Frozen documentary on Netflix, shared tips on storyboarding.

* [Bbinko](https://www.instagram.com/bbinko/), **illustrator-influencer** with almost 500,000 followers in Instagram, shared her experiences in creating high-impact content and pitching.

* [Toffie](https://www.facebook.com/toffieisitsupport), **e-sport and tech vlogger**,  provided feedback on students’ video pitches.

* Leading experts on **design thinking** helped students craft their key messages for the right target audience, and a **creative psychologist** worked with the students on effective storytelling.

Bringing many people together is never without its own set of challenges—aligning on shared objectives, speaking with one voice to our participants, and the logistical aspects to make this happen is always tough—however, it’s worth the effort!

**Main Takeaway: **By involving stakeholders from a variety of fields, the youth gained fresh perspectives on the topic of digital safety (which makes it cool), and the partners involved are energized by interacting with youth, creating more buy-in for the activity goals.

## 3. Let the Youth Lead

![Thaniya 5.png](/uploads/Thaniya%205.png)

When we talk about digital citizenship, especially about digital safety and cybersecurity, many people shy away from the topic since everything seems so theoretical and far away from their day-to-day realities. We didn’t want to just give students answers about digital safety. They can Google that themselves, probably faster than most of us working in international development.

Gen Z’s influence in the digital world is undeniable—as are their fresh perspectives. So instead of us telling them about what’s important and what digital citizenship and safety should look like throughout the program, we should let them tell us.
The challenge we gave to the participants was to convey digital safety messages in a concise, accessible manner, through a creative 90-second video.

To prepare for the development of their videos, we asked the students in a bootcamp session to share their thoughts—through the lens of positive online communication, online identity and security, news literacy, and critical thinking—about a case study of a Thai celebrity trying to sell heath supplements.

At first the youth were very shy to speak up, but as we continuously emphasized that this is a supportive place with no judgement—a private Facebook group with only the program participants and the organizers—students started to feel that it was indeed a safe space. And they started having fun!

One student analyzed the importance of news literacy and critical thinking:

*“\[Influencers have\] the power to create positive influence to many people … It can be tempting to buy a product from someone who is famous in society. The media should do their best to ensure that the information that is publicized is true. As a reader, we need to carefully assess the news and understand the true intent behind the news."*

Through facilitated discussions and self-directed learning, participants are getting the opportunity to truly understand the concepts of digital citizenship and safety in order to be able to convey this message in their creative videos for the Thai public.
This is not to say that the ideas generated by the students were immediately ready for the market. It was the mentors' role to guide the students to refine their concepts, as well as learn with the youth throughout their journey.

**Main Takeaway: **Organizers should ask more than tell, especially when working with youth. We’re here to foster their creativity, and to learn with them. Young people live digital citizenship every day, they have the solutions—and we should be holding a space to help their insights emerge.

## 4. Pitching Makes Perfect

![Thaniya 6.png](/uploads/Thaniya%206.png)

Learning digital safety and content production concepts though bootcamps is great, but then what? What did the students learn, and how do we know what they absorbed?

Instead of an evaluation form for the students to fill in as a formative assessment, we asked the students to enter a Shark-Tank-type pitching session. Students were given the task of conveying their creative video concepts on digital citizenship and safety within two minutes to four panelists with expertise in digital ecosystems and content creation.

The pitching session helped us achieve the program goals in several ways.

First, it was a knowledge check for our participants. What would positive online behavior look like in real life? How concisely can they convey their ideas so that complicated theories like online privacy become demystified and actionable? Are they able to do this in ways that are persuasive and have a strong impact on an external audience? How can they make people care about what they are trying to say?

One student shared after the session that, *"I really liked this \[pitching\] opportunity to share about the topic of positive online communication. If we learn how to share this message well \[to the panelists\], then we might have more impact \[with the videos\] as a result."*

Secondly, the pitching session boosted the energy for students like nothing else. A sense of competition (student teams that delivered the best pitches won small prizes), combined with public speaking in order to persuade experts to “buy” their ideas was an adrenaline rush for the participants. Many students, of course, had the classic hiccups of running out of time, or technical issues where the slides or the microphone did not work – but that’s real life!

Lastly, the pitching session was a chance to engage our key stakeholders, including representatives from the USAID and the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, Facebook Thailand, prominent Thai influencers, and the organizing team. Because we were working with nearly 400 students, we had to break up the pitching sessions to span over three days. More than ten volunteers from all parties rotated through to provide constructive feedback to the students so that they could further develop their videos.

For international development professionals, it was a rare treat during the pandemic to get the chance to interact with youth. Facebook staff got the chance to participate in meaningful corporate social responsibility activities, as well as the opportunity to educate their most active customers about the positive benefits of their platform. For social media influencers, this pitching session provided them with brand visibility to their target audience—youth —as well as the chance to give back to their current and future followers.

While the pitching session required lots of time from our partners, it also provided them with the opportunity to contribute to the society where they work, as well as improve their connections to their customer base.

**Main Takeaway: **Pitching sessions are great ways to verify what participants are learning, to build excitement with the participants, and also allows us to engage our partners in meaningful ways.

## 5. Crowdsource the Creativity

## What's Next

Now that the students have completed their pitches, they will work with mentors in March to develop their videos and start their journey of becoming micro-influencers and champions of positive digital cyberspaces in Thailand.

By the beginning of May 2021, student teams will have produced a total of nearly 100 videos. Some initial video ideas were happy and light, some were dark and thoughtful. Without the Wai Kid Digital collaborative design, there was no way one project could have dreamed up all these ideas about digital citizenship and safety.
If there is one thing you remember from this blog, please design with and for humans in your next program activity, especially if you are focusing on technology. If it is anything like our digital citizenship experiment in Thailand, the creative outputs will help you get better results.
