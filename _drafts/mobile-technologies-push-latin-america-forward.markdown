The digital ecosystem in Latin America is pushing countries to accelerate public-private collaboration on digital transformation.

At the recent [GSMA Mobile 360 LATAM conference](https://www.mobile360series.com/latin-america/agenda/), we constantly heard about how 5G networks are expected to bring about a technological, economic, and social revolution around the world. Many speakers, including GSMA's CEO Mat Granryd, urged authorities and industry to work jointly to accelerate the adoption of 5G networks in the region so that Latin America is not left behind.

Tied directly to the issue of 5G is the question of the Internet of Things (IoT). According to a [study by Frost & Sullivan](https://www.principalglobal.com/knowledge/insights/5g-latin-america-a-regions-global-competitiveness-stake), the trend in Latin America is that in the next four years there the number of IoT devices in the region will grow by 300%, increasing from 313.3 million devices today to almost 1 billion by 2023. In the region, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico are the leading the IoT revolution.

For example,  Brazil recently launched its [national IoT plan](https://dig.watch/updates/brazil-launch-national-iot-plan). As the first in the region to do so, its likely that other countries will follow suit. This trend holds promise for Latin America to position itself to take advantage of the next phase of the digital revolution. Nevertheless, in comparison to other regions, like the high-income countries in Asia, Latin America has a lot of catching up to do. South Korea launched its national IoT plan 10 years ago.

Although Latin America has a long road ahead to fully establish itself as a region leading on IoT integration, the conference demonstrated the real accomplishments of the digital market in the region.  Companies such as Napify, [winner of the 4YFN Pitch](https://elempresario.mx/emprendedores/napify-startup-que-premia-no-usar-tu-celular-gana-concurso-regional), showed its advances in gamification to promote safe driving. Others, such as [Buro de Identidad Digital](https://www.buroidentidad.com/) (biometrics) showed how it is pushing digitization of identification in the region. In addition, there was also a cohort of regional and international companies that are advancing IoT in Latin America. The combination of these companies generates greater pressure on operators and telecommunications companies to improve their infrastructure and take steps towards rolling out a 5G network.

## Opportunities for the Region

For us at the Center for Digital Acceleration, the conference was a reminder of the immense opportunities in the region in terms of social impact—such as:

1. There is a clear commitment from government officials, large companies, startups, and other actors to democratize the use of technologies across countries. At the moment, the cost of smartphones and data plans makes it difficult for the majority of people in the region to engage. But with the advent of 5G, experts anticipate that costs will be reduced making digital tools like smartphones more accessible to all segments of society in the region.

2. If the hype around 5G and IoT devices is true, new solutions to old problems such as unemployment, poor education, low inclusion, human insecurity, and food insecurity, will enter the market.

3. Lastly, private sector actors in the region are seriously concerned that without the support of national and local governments to enact legislation that enables the rollout of 5G, Latin America will be left behind in comparison to the rest of the world. Their commitment and engagement is key.

For Latin America, the rollout of 5G offers an opportunity to leverage the digital economy to expand into markets that previously were unreachable to many countries. Furthermore, if rolled out with the goal of bridging the digital divide, it offers an opportunity to provide access to critical services to previously excluded populations.
