The digital ecosystem in Latin America is pushing countries to accelerate public-private collaboration on digital transformation.

At the recent [GSMA Mobile 360 LATAM conference](https://www.mobile360series.com/latin-america/agenda/), we constantly heard about how 5G networks are expected to bring about a technological, economic, and social revolution around the world. Many speakers, including GSMA's CEO Mat Granryd, urged authorities and industry to work jointly to accelerate the adoption of 5G networks in the region so that Latin America is not left behind.

Tied directly to the issue of 5G is the question of the Internet of Things (IoT). According to a [study by Frost & Sullivan](https://www.principalglobal.com/knowledge/insights/5g-latin-america-a-regions-global-competitiveness-stake), the trend in Latin America is that in the next four years there will growth of more than 300 percent in IoT devices, increasing from 313.3 million devices today, to almost 1 billion in the 2023. In the region, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico are the leading the IoT revolution.

It is no surprise then that Brazil recently launched its [national IoT plan](https://dig.watch/updates/brazil-launch-national-iot-plan). As the first in the region, it seems likely that other countries will follow. Although this is a great accomplishment and shows a focus to the future, when compared to other regions, its seems like Latin America is already falling behind. For instance, South Korea launched its national IoT plan in 2009.

That said, the conference was truly inspiring and exposed us to the versatile digital market across Latin America. The conference was also an opportunity for innovative companies to present about their work. Companies like Napify, winner of the 4YFN Pitch, showed their advances in the gamification theme to promote safe behavior of the population while driving. Others, like Buro de Identidad Digital (biometrics) showed the push makes the digitization of identifications in the region. In addition, there was also a cohort of regional and international companies that are advancing IoT in LAC. The combination of these companies generates greater pressure on operators and telecommunications companies to improve their infrastructure and take steps towards rolling out a 5G network.

## Opportunities for the region

As the Center for Digital Acceleration, the Mobile 360 Conference was a reminder of the immense opportunities in the region in terms of social impact. Some of these opportunities include:

1. There was a clear commitment from government officials, large companies, startups and other actors to democratize the use of technologies across countries. At the moment, the cost of smartphones and data plans makes it difficult for the majority of people in the region to purchase one. Yet with the advent of 5G, experts anticipate that costs will be reduced making digital tools like smartphones more accessible to all segments of society in the region.

2. There was also excitement that because if advent of 5G and the rollout of IoT devices, new alternatives to old problems such as employment, education, inclusion, security, and agriculture, will enter the market.

3. Lastly, at the conference there was a serious concern from private sector actors in the region that without the support of national and local governments to enact legislation that enables the rollout of 5G, Latin America will be left behind in comparison to the rest of the world. This will be because without government support, 5G rollout will likely be slower.

For Latin America, the rollout of 5G offers an opportunity to leverage the digital economy to expand into markets that previously were unreachable to many countries. Furthermore, if rolled out with the goal of bridging the digital divide, it offers an opportunity to provide access to critical services to previously excluded populations.
