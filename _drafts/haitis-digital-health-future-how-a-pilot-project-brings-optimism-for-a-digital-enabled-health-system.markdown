Last week I presented in a TechChange course entitled the Future of Digital Health. I was asked to discuss the implementation of the USAID-funded Haiti Strategic Health Information System (HIS) program, a 5-year program that works to consolidate and integrate Haiti’s disconnected health information assets. Preparing for this presentation gave me a chance to reflect on the past year - the progress we have made, the challenges we have encountered and the future of digital health in Haiti.

Before I dive into the specifics of the pilot that I presented, let me give you a scenario.

Imagine a not too distant Digital Future of Haiti: A country where Ministry of Health of Haiti (MSPP) has access to entire health data spectrum for decision making. Where information is turned into knowledge, where data is collected and analyzed, aggregated in real-time, on mobile phone, at the touch of button. Imagine that department level decisions (Haiti is divided administratively into 10 departments) are guided by programs based on live streaming data, such disease burden tracking data, costing information, and supply chain data. And, imagine if that data is instantly collected, curated and securely available. This is the image of health workers in modern, paperless health facility.

We are well on our way to reach such a vision. The future is now. The pilot that we are running is the first step. It enables the use of DHIS2 at the health facility level as a tracker to collect tuberculosis (TB) patient-level data, track patient progress, and feed the national health information system. The pilot runs from January – March 2018 and targets nine facilities and four departments (48% of all TB facilities). This may not seem like too big lift, but it is certainly a step in the right direction. If we can prove the efficiency and impact of collecting data at every level of the health system, we can actually start making crucial decisions based on accurate data.

Fast forward to the third month of the pilot. There is no doubt that progress has been made. For all participating facilities, 52% of all expected TB cases during this quarter have been entered into the system. This number is only rising and we are hoping to reach our goal of 75% by the end of the month. We have also seen outstanding leadership by *System d’Information Sanitaire Nationale Unique (*SISNU) through the National Program to Fight Against Tuberculosis (PNLT) and the Unit for Studies and Programming (UEP), two entities within the MSPP.

But, with any future thinking comes challenges to solve, such as being able to track a patient across multiple health facilities. Time for another scenario.

Imagine this: A patient goes into a facility and is diagnosed with TB in January. The health worker, trained in the new tracking system, diagnoses the patient, prescribes medications, inputs the patient’s information into the tracker, and records her biometrics. This way, when she comes back for a checkup, no matter the facility, the health worker can securely pull up her previous diagnosis and treatment to seamlessly provide the care she needs.

This is what we hope to achieve in the future using biometrics. It will serve as a means of providing patients with unique identifiers that can track them throughout the health system. This enables patients to have consistency in care if they switch facilities for whatever reason. Of course, this solution required patient consent along with adhering to patient’s right to protect his/her personal data. Another step forward toward the Digital vision for Haiti.

I am incredibly optimistic about what these changes could bring. If we roll out the pilot and continue entering data at the facility level, the quality of the data will improve, allowing for the use of good data for decision making. But, more importantly, patient tracking of TB treatment and hopefully tracking of all patient-level health data will result in better, more targeted care. Both improvements will lead to improved health outcomes. This is our goal and I am looking forward to tackling the challenges along the way to achieve the Digital Future for Haiti.
