World over, digital tools are creating opportunities for the unbanked, and expanding the array of financial services on offer.

![FSDM-08280e.jpg](/uploads/FSDM-08280e.jpg)Mozambique is no exception – whilst literacy rates are low, and the ICT infrastructure and regulatory framework are underdeveloped, traditional banking is still not serving people’s needs. The financial inclusion rate is a rather low [13%](https://uncdf-cdn.azureedge.net/media-manager/86055?sv=2016-05-31&sr=b&sig=aUjmuD2ZtJsftoK7ZR4O1JULKqqAETmoMlyw6sGwZAo%3D&se=2018-10-20T16%3A34%3A14Z&sp=r) in Mozambique and there is a clear need for financial services to be available for poorer, more rural and marginalised populations.

Enter the [Financial Sector Deepening Programme](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/mozambique-financial-sector-deepening-fsdmoc), Moçambique. Funded by UK DFID and Sweden, FSDMoç is a facility for financial sector development with a focus on expanding financial inclusion for marginalised populations, not currently served by formal financial institutions. The project’s innovative investments aim to address constraints in the financial market, helping the diversification of Mozambique’s economy and bringing prosperity and economic resilience to Mozambique’s people.

Initial scoping research conducted at the start of the programme revealed that, despite the relative newness of the Mozambican FinTech industry, much of the growth in FinTech is supported by development funding national and international competitions and a commercial bank incubator initiative. There was a clear gap to be filled not just in the provision of FinTech, but in its funding and development.

To provide much needed support and funding for FinTech, the Mozambique Sandbox – the 3rd regulatory sandbox in Africa after Zambia (Information and Communication Technology Authority) and Sierra Leona – was launched by the Central Bank Governor in May 2018.

The Sandbox, located in Maputo, is currently incubating five FinTech start-ups, selected through [a fintech challenge](http://fsdmoc.com/fsdmoc-addressing-financial-sector-regulation-challenges-regulatory-sandbox-story/). The incubator provides a valuable opportunity for these FinTech start-ups to interact with Central Bank and creates opportunities for development, testing and demonstration of products; and opportunities for FinTechs and the Central Bank to learn from one another and share innovative ideas.

Here we give an introduction to the start-ups, selected through the challenge, what they are developing and how they are addressing the issue of financial exclusion in Mozambique. They are creating and testing a variety of solutions, from developing local and cross border remittance services to testing alternative payment systems. And now on to the introductions!

# **Quick-e-Pay**

In response to the growing use of mobile wallets and need for the ability to pay for goods and services online, tech company *Ekutiva* are creating an online payment aggregator system - [Quick-e-Pay](http://www.quickepay.co.mz) - which is currently being built and developed under the supervision of the Central Bank.

Their solution aims to change the local financial market by increasing digitalisation of transactions in local currency. The Ekuvita team hope that Quick-e-Pay ​can improve financial inclusion by leveraging free online payments for goods and services, integrating e-finance into the Mozambican ecosystem, and opening up e-finance opportunities for all Mozambicans. They envisage a local farmer using their platform to sell vegetables to a nearby city supermarket; a food delivery company that can offer food online with payment confirmation.

# **PagaLu**

Robobo Incorporated Ltd is a Mozambican ICT development agency, with headquarters in Maputo. Robobo has recently been developing a FinTech solution known as PagaLu, which is a payment aggregator service that enables payments between mobile wallets, bank accounts and other methods. PagaLu is aimed at startups, entrepreneurs, content creators, and all who wish to monetize or accept payments from the majority of the commonly used means of transaction. Currently the solution is in a pilot phase with companies in the news subscriptions market and is expecting to manage over ten thousand daily transactions at start. Robobo’s vision is to grow the FinTech sector in Mozambique, expanding opportunities for small businesses.

# **PAYTEK**

[PAYTEK](http://paytek-africa.com) is a new Mozambican Fintech that operates as a Payment Services Aggregator Provider. They provide payment integration services, application interfaces and access channels for companies and individuals to perform all kinds of Digital Financial Services. Their e-wallet will allow end-users to continue to use their bank accounts and mobile wallets to carry out the payment of services and purchases but in a more intuitive, comprehensive and conscious way. They are designing new systems for low-value payments such as transport, public service taxes, and show entrance fees. They hope that by streamlining the digital finance process, they can promote among fellow Mozambicans a sustained habit of making electronic payments, instead of using physical money.

# **Zoona and Socremo**

[Zoona](https://ilovezoona.com/) and [Socremo](http://www.socremo.com/) are working on a new digital banking solution allowing money transfers, payments, savings and credit to reach a greater number of Mozambicans. They feel strongly that financial inclusion should be a right for all, and so wish to create a solution that is easy to access, easy to understand, and easy to use. Their target audience are low-income heads of households such as tradesmen and farmers. Their product will have the ability to store money; send money; buy airtime and pay bills; save money; get access to credit; and have a bank card. All of these services will be available on mobile phone using USSD, once an individual has been registered by an agent. They hope that by using simple solutions such as USSD, they are providing a lower barrier to entry, making the FinTech market more inclusive.

# **Mukuru**

[Mukuru](https://www.mukuru.com) is the largest money transfer organisation in South Africa. Their product allows individuals to send remittances around Africa, through phone call, website, and dedicated agents. Due to the significant volumes of remittances moving informally into Mozambique, mostly via mini-buses, Mukuru have identified Mozambique as a key market to their already successful product. They propose to work under supervision from other Central Banks in the various African territories, to formalise the informal remittance market and provide a safe, reliable, and recorded way of sending money to Mozambique to those who are typically financially excluded.

Working with the Central Bank on the Regulatory Sandbox has to date increased both the Bank’s understanding of the FinTech sector, and the start-ups’ understanding of the requirements of the Central Bank, allowing them to garner much-needed buy-in from the Bank. FSD Mozambique will continue to support the five start-ups, and we look forward to hearing more about their products and how they are working towards a more financially inclusive Mozambique!
