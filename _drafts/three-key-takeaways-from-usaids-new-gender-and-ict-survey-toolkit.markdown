This past week USAID's Global Development Lab and mStar released the [Gender and ICT Survey Toolkit](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/15396/Gender_and_ICT_Toolkit.pdf). In an informative webinar (you can listen to the recording [here](http://solutionscenter.nethope.org/webinars/view/introducing-usaids-gender-and-ict-toolkit)), the team that produced the report discussed both the content and the context surrounding the genesis of the toolkit. I tuned in and spent the majority of the time silently cheering my computer screen, thrilled to hear USAID promoting research tactics and information needs that align with what we on DAI's ICT team are doing with our [Digital Insights](https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=digital-insights) work. In between cheers, I feverishly took notes to capture my three key takeaways below.

**1. Qualitative *and* quantitative data are equally important**
One of the main pushbacks we get on Digital Insights is that we don't seek out statistically significant, national-level sample populations. 

2. Local, small-n data collection has an important role in ICT4D

3. Pushing beyond the what's to the why's is key, especially when designing for vulnerable communities like women
