Frontier Insights: Cyber Security Edition
 
The headline says it all: “[Over a billion people’s data was compromised in 2018](https://nordvpn.com/blog/biggest-data-breaches-2018/),” according to a year-end post on NordVPN’s blog, and among the most egregious offenders were some of the most popular tech platforms in the world. Facebook, for example, admitted it had leaked the personal data of nearly 150 million users; Twitter leaked the passwords of nearly all 330 million of its users; and even mighty Google had two of its products hacked: Firebase (an app monitoring tool) leaked the data of more than 100 million users, and Google+ leaked 500,000 users’ personal info.

NordVPN’s unmistakable message is that the state of cyber security within some of the world’s most prominent organizations remains weak in 2018; likely a fact that escaped only those living under very heavy rocks. It certainly didn’t escape Congress, which called in the CEOs of Facebook and Google to testify in a series of highly-charged (and sometimes hilariously [ham-handed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-lMIGV-dUI)) hearings about privacy and data security. 

These high-profile data breaches and the subsequent congressional hearings are how—at a societal level—we generate greater public awareness and scrutiny of digital services at home in the United States. Hopefully this additional scrutiny will lead to more awareness and expectations among the public, better practices on the part of the platforms, and more trust and accountability between the two (Facebook’s [stock price](https://www.newsweek.com/facebook-stock-price-fb-messenger-sharing-private-messages-netflix-spotify-1265319), if not the size of its [user base](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/amp/2019/01/youd-have-to-pay-someone-usd1-000-to-stop-using-facebook.html), would seem to depend on it), but what about people in the places where USAID and DAI work? DAI’s [Frontier Insights](https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=digital-insights) work is all about understanding how people are using technology, and how they’re sharing and seeking information via digital tools, and over the last two years we’ve learned quite a lot about how the people we support think about cyber security. Three key lessons:

## 1. Most people don’t know to be worried
Across our Frontier Insights work—which by now includes thousands of interviews across developing countries—there’s one overarching lesson: people love digital tools. They love WhatsApp, Facebook, Google, just like we do, and generally for the same reasons: freedom to explore the world at a single touch from the safety of home; most of the information known to humankind at palm’s reach; and instant connect us instantly to the people we care about. Facebook, in particular, is omnipresent. Almost everywhere we’ve done Frontier Insights, we’ve found heavy usage, particularly among youth and particularly in urban areas, where 3G and 4G are more accessible. This pattern has held across [Cambodia](https://dai-global-digital.com/cambodia-civil-society-facebook.html), [Honduras](https://dai-global-digital.com/mobiles-in-central-america-digital-insights-honduras-part-2.html), [Palestine](https://dai-global-digital.com/consumer-insights-palestine-e-governance-readiness.html), [Afghanistan](https://dai-global-digital.com/consumer-insights-afghanistan-how-young-women-are-using-tech.html), and [Bangladesh](https://dai-global-digital.com/digital-insights-bangladesh-how-urban-youth-stay-connected.html) and just about everywhere else we’ve asked about it. The only exception has been rural [Rwanda]( https://dai-global-digital.com/digital-insights-rwanda.html) and [Malawi](https://dai-global-digital.com/digital-insights-malawi-communication-among-rural-communities.html), where 3G data and smartphones are—to date—rare, but in the places where Facebook is popular, it’s growing even more so, even as US teens have been [abandoning the platform](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/02/21/why-teens-are-leaving-facebook-its-meaningless/?utm_term=.04a8788a503b) for some time. 
Do these Facebook users understand how the platform works? Do they know what they’re giving up in exchange for access? If they did, [would they care?](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/amp/2019/01/youd-have-to-pay-someone-usd1-000-to-stop-using-facebook.html). All questions for future Frontier Insights research. 

## 2. Trust remains a major challenge for digital platforms not named Facebook in developing countries

This is not to say that *everyone* is on the Facebook train. No, there remains a great deal of skepticism among people about technology in general, not just social media. For example, in [Haiti](https://dai-global-digital.com/digital-insights-would-haitians-use-mobile-money-for-banking.html), many of the people we interviewed said that they didn’t trust mobile money systems because they weren’t transparent and were perceived to steal users’ money. In Afghanistan (blog post coming soon), many of the people we interviewed late last year said that they did not trust online vendors because they couldn’t be guaranteed of the product’s quality and durability. Is this skepticism the result of the recent data breaches? Probably not. But in years past, ICT4D specialists and others who promote new technologies might have greeted these concerns with a knowing nod and a quiet confidence that such skepticism was unfounded; but the lesson of 2018 is that maybe the skeptics had it right all along. 

## 3. We can’t rely on platforms themselves to take these threats seriously, especially in developing countries

Both Google and Facebook to sell user data to advertisers, who use that data to target ads for their products. The more data they can get about their users, the more valuable that data is; so, where’s the incentive to be secure, transparent and accountable? A few million users’ data From the standpoint of accountability, while the US Congress might haul the CEO of a Facebook or a Google in front of the cameras for a dressing down, Cambodia and Honduras can’t. Sure, they can shut the platform down in their country, but that’s an approach fraught with its own risks. When Brazil shut down [WhatsApp in 2016], people marched in the streets and soon after the government caved. Instead of bringing WhatsApp to heel, they made it more powerful and popular than before. 

Given that, can we depend on developing country governments that have difficulty with basic service provision to educate their populations on cyber security and data protection best practices? It would seem unlikely--and it is precisely that sort of gap that the international development community and ICT4D practitioners should be stepping.
