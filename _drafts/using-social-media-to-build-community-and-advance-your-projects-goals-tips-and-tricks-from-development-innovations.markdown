For those of us who follow the tech world, big tech has [suffered](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/what-its-like-to-own-an-amazon-ring-doorbell-camera.html) [in](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126970/apple-iphone-independent-repair-contract-search-audit) [the](https://www.ft.com/content/6ec3f6a6-4d56-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5) [press](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-why-facebook-agreed-to-pay-550-million-privacy-settlement-to-illinois-2020-02-09) [lately](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/microsoft-accidentally-exposed-250-million-customer-support-records-online-heres-what-you-should-know.html). Even development practitioners have been [getting in](https://www.ictworks.org/facebook-digital-development/#.Xkq6_ihKg2y) [on the game](https://www.devex.com/news/what-the-facebook-scandal-means-for-data-for-good-92425). However, I like to keep things interesting – so here is a positive story about [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) helping catalyze a community of innovators in Cambodia on USAID’s [Development Innovations (DI) ](https://www.development-innovations.org/)program.
From 2013-2019, the $12M USAID-funded DI project helped civil society organizations (CSOs), technology companies, social enterprises and young innovators design and use information and communications technology (ICT) solutions to tackle Cambodia’s development challenges. A key aspect of DI’s success was its ability to harness social media to advance its project goals. DI’s approach to strategic communications was twofold: not only did DI create captivating social media content, but it trained Cambodian CSOs and social enterprises to tell their own compelling stories using data-driven insights and a smartphone. In doing so, DI helped demystify a new communications method for Cambodian civil society. They can now reach thousands of people more quickly and less expensively than ever before, and to better understand and liaise with the people they serve.

**The context: in Cambodia, Facebook is king**

Facebook is unquestionably the most popular social media site in Cambodia. As noted in the 2019 [Start-Up Kingdom](https://www.raintreecambodia.com/research) report, over 40% of Cambodia’s population used Facebook in early 2018, with this number expected to rapidly grow to over 50% in less than a year. According to a poll conducted to inform this report, 38% of respondents reported using the Internet – but 46% reported using Facebook. This implies that a decent chunk of the Cambodian population perceives Facebook to **be** the internet. Based on my own personal experience, Facebook pervades almost all aspects of life in Phnom Penh. From using Facebook Messenger for professional purposes (instead of email), to buying goods and services, to advertising events, to making restaurant reservations, Facebook is ubiquitous. For this reason, DI chose to focus its social media efforts on Facebook – though many of its lessons learned are applicable to any social media platform.

**Using social media to advance DI’s program objectives**

DI’s significant Facebook (and, to a lesser extent, Youtube and Twitter) presence helped build DI’s brand and lend credibility to its partners and grantees. Facebook proved transformative for the project. On a near daily basis, the DI team designed, generated and published Facebook posts and videos in Khmer and English to its 46,000\+ followers, which generated an average monthly reach of 150,000. Some DI videos posted to Facebook went viral within Cambodia: for example, a video about smartphone video training was viewed almost 250,000 times and shared over 800 times in less than four months in 2019.

DI built a trusted brand on Facebook by:

* *Serving as a trusted source of information*** **– DI marketed its social media channels as a definitive source of information for Cambodian organizations using technology to increase their social impact. The DI team regularly posted content on a range of topics – everything from new funding opportunities within Cambodia’s tech ecosystem, videos with tips and tricks for professional networking, photos from its own events, and job ads for roles at trusted tech sector/ICT4D organizations. In addition to promoting its own programming, DI regularly highlighted its partners and their accomplishments, as well as other actors in the ecosystem. This brought greater attention to its beneficiaries, helped win the trust of key stakeholders, and allowed DI to gain visibility among key players within Cambodia’s civic tech ecosystem and the broader public. These varied tactics helped increase its number of followers, and by extension, the reach of its posts and videos.


* *Using analytics to drive relevant content* – The DI team regularly used social media analytics to analyze the performance of their posts and videos. On a monthly basis, the team used Facebook’s Audience Insights tool to analyze the reach and popularity of their posts. They began to optimize their content, emulating successful posts (in terms of likes, reshares, and overall reach) and dropping less popular content. For example, 2016 data showed that videos were viewed much more frequently than written posts or photos, leading the team to prioritize video creation. By the end of 2019, DI videos were regularly generating thousands of likes in less than a week. DI also tracked analytics on its network of decision-makers and donors through Twitter and created content that spoke to their needs.


* *Investing in its strategic communications function *– DI prioritized its strategic communications staff as a means to achieve its project goals, setting it apart from many other donor-funded projects. By the end of DI’s lifespan, more than 1/3 of DI staff members focused on social media strategy and content creation and on training up local partners in this niche area. Bringing this set of capabilities in-house made the DI team more agile, able to understand and execute on the needs of the project and the local tech sector. It also helped ensure that its strategic communications coaches – working with local partners to improve their communications functions – also reflected DI’s values and built its brand.
