For those of us who follow the tech world, big tech has [suffered](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/what-its-like-to-own-an-amazon-ring-doorbell-camera.html) [in](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126970/apple-iphone-independent-repair-contract-search-audit) [the](https://www.ft.com/content/6ec3f6a6-4d56-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5) [press](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-why-facebook-agreed-to-pay-550-million-privacy-settlement-to-illinois-2020-02-09) [lately](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/microsoft-accidentally-exposed-250-million-customer-support-records-online-heres-what-you-should-know.html).

However, I like to keep things interesting – so here is a positive story about [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) helping catalyze a community of innovators in Cambodia on USAID’s [Development Innovations (DI) ](https://www.development-innovations.org/)program.
From 2013-2019, the $12M USAID-funded DI project helped civil society organizations (CSOs), technology companies, social enterprises and young innovators design and use information and communications technology (ICT) solutions to tackle Cambodia’s development challenges. A key aspect of DI’s success was its ability to harness social media to advance its project goals. DI’s approach to strategic communications was twofold: not only did DI create captivating social media content, but it trained Cambodian CSOs and social enterprises to tell their own compelling stories using data-driven insights and a smartphone. In doing so, DI helped demystify a new communications method for Cambodian civil society. They can now reach thousands of people more quickly and less expensively than ever before, and to better understand and liaise with the people they serve.
