In February, I wrote a [piece](http://dai-global-digital.com/2016/02/23/sowing-the-seeds-of-a-tech-for-social-good-ecosystem-in-afghanistan.html) about Code Weekend, a tech-for-social-good organization based in Kabul. Here’s an exciting update: last month, they launched their first [Code Women Challenge](http://challenge.codeweekend.af/register.php) aimed at creating smartphone apps to counter the harassment that women often face on the streets of Afghanistan. Nine teams submitted their concepts, and two of them tied for first place in the competition.

The three female coders from the winning teams -- Fatima Shefaie and Alina Niko of Life Technology, and Freshta Habibzay, a freelancer -- will join forces to complete and deploy their app. It will have a number of features: crowdsourced maps and live notifications of areas where harassment is rampant, distress SMS alerts to friends and family, and tips on avoiding and handling incidents when they occur. The team has been given AFA 300,00 (around USD $4,500) to design the app.

Says Jamshid Hashimi, Code Weekend’s founder:

> “Coding is so important to our generation. We live in an era of digital literacy and computer science. By engaging in the Code Women Challenge, women have the chance to be innovative and creative in solving problems that affect everyone,”

The funds for this project come from three USAID-funded projects: Women in the Economy and Musharikat (both under Promote), and Assistance in Building Afghanistan Developing Enterprises (ABADE).
