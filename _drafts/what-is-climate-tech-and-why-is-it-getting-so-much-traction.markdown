The term “climate tech” encompasses both physical and digital technologies that seek to remove emissions from the atmosphere and encourage people to address climate-related issues. While the term is broad and has become somewhat popular in recent years, the practice of climate tech is not entirely new. The [Kyoto Protocol](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-kyoto-protocol/what-is-the-kyoto-protocol/kyoto-protocol-targets-for-the-first-commitment-period), which was signed in the mid-1990s helped to establish flexible market mechanisms based on the trade emissions permit, supports the concept that technology can help us adapt to and mitigate climate change. Since the signing of the Kyoto Protocol, hundreds of technology-driven initiatives have sought to respond climate-related issues. 

Climate tech is classified by two categories: mitigation or adaption. Mitigation is described as making the effects of climate change less severe by avoiding or reducing the emissions of greenhouse gasses (GHG) into the atmosphere. Adaption is the process of adjusting and increasing resilience to the current and future effects of climate change.

Climate tech must comply with the below principles and criteria:

1. **Use of historical data** for short- and medium-term analysis of scenarios applied to sectors such as agriculture, housing, ecosystem services, human health, and more. Climate change is a cross-cutting issue that affects everything in our daily lives. 
1. **Help quantify the environmental impact** caused by economic, social, or individual activities to achieve zero CO2 emissions, net zero emissions, or climate neutrality—each of which has a different set of actions that can be followed and implications for the future. 
1. **Generate new data and information** supported by science to respond to existing problems caused by global warming. 

The recent legal commitments countries made through the [Paris Agreement](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/paris-agreement) and the [Glasgow Climate Pact](https://unfccc.int/documents/310475) have brought increased awareness and conversations surrounding climate tech.

Both treaties are focused on three solutions: 

1. Limit the average increase in global temperature to 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels.
1. Redouble efforts not to exceed the level of 1.5 degrees at the end of the century. 
1. Achieve climate neutrality by 2050.

International development investment strategies rely on the international mandates and entrepreneurial ecosystems are generating solutions using emerging technologies to respond to climate-related issues to satisfy the unprecedented demand to help save the planet. Many actors are looking to aggressively address countries, companies, and individuals that emit large amounts of [GHG](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases) into the atmosphere using technology, as the intense impact of climate change is increasing sea levels, causing major floods and intense hurricanes and storms, as well as prolonging droughts and rises in temperature that directly impact health, food security, and ecosystem balances. 

# So, What is DAI's Center for Digital Acceleration (CDA( doing? 

In recent years, CDA has interacted with new climate-tech tools. Below are some examples: 

## Climate Data Hub for Central America

To provide information, predictions, and data to better react to climate change and increase variability in tropical regions, Central American countries developed [Centro Clima](https://centroclima.org/). Centro Clima, developed in 2015, was the first center to integrate 40 years of data, information, and tools, including the Central American Climate Data Base with models such as the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. WRF is a next-generation mesoscale numerical weather prediction system. 

## Clima Pesca

[Clima Pesca](https://climapesca.org/) provides meteorological monitoring for fishermen. The deluge of data and underutilized data is one of the ailments of this era. However, through a user-centered design, CDA developed Clima Pesca, an application that integrates relevant weather information for fishermen in an easy and simple way, transforming a PDF newsletter into a multi-channel platform. Developed in 2017, Clima Pesca helps 120,000 fishermen annually. 

## Coffee Cloud

Developed in 2018, [Coffee Cloud](https://www.anacafe.org/coffee-cloud/) is a climate-tech solution for coffee cultivation. The solution analyzed climate data and trends in coffee plants to reduce the presence of coffee rust in Central America. Coffee cloud is currently used in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Costa Rica by more than 6,000 producers.

## Climate Tool for Assess Risks and Preparedness 

In partnership with the DAI’s Sustainable Business Group, CDA developed the [Climate Tool for Assess Risks and Preparedness (CTARP)](https://dai-global-digital.com/how-digital-climate-risk-assessment-tools-can-help-unclog-climate-finance-flows-in-emerging-economies.html) in 2021. The tool is a response to a need in the financial and banking sector to better assess the current and future climate risk on lending and providing mitigation strategies for climate change effects.

While climate tech may be a buzzword for now, it is a multidisciplinary field that has existed long before the word for formalized. As the public and private sectors begin to mobilize on climate change, the term climate tech will transition to a standardized way of approaching problems rather than a specific sector looking for anxious stability.
