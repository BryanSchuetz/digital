  Access'

![SDG9.png](/uploads/SDG9.png)In our quest to increase digital we tend to focus on the digital dividends, rather than the negatives that could arise from digital access. We are understandably excited about [edging closer to universal access](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2018/01/worlds-vulnerable-countries-track-achieve-universal-internet-access-2020-un-report/){:.float-left}, or the new business opportunities and improvements to service provision that accompany it. But while we are good at focusing on safety and security, the gender digital divide, and are increasingly considering how to not leave out PWDs (all great stuff!), there could be more negative consequences of increased digital access that are overlooked. 

Let’s imagine that it is 2030 and we have achieved the goal under [SDG 9](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/infrastructure-industrialization/): universal access. In a future where access is “universal”, how can we balance being excited about the digital dividends whilst ensuring we are not making assumptions about access that are potentially detrimental?

## 1. Do Design Properly
There was a time when we would think “rural Nigeria- surely no one will have a mobile phone there”. Nowadays when I speak to colleagues about upcoming projects, they are more likely to say they “know” that everyone has a mobile phone in rural Rwanda or that WhatsApp is “clearly” the most used app in urban Bangladesh. To make sure we aren’t basing our project on assumptions, we – and many other good ICT4D practitioners - are real proponents of [designing with the user](https://digitalprinciples.org/principle/design-with-the-user/): meeting the users where they are to find out the who, what, when, where and why of technology use. 

Even if 100% of your focus group say they have access, it might be worth digging a little deeper or expanding your pool of interviewees. Do they have a grandma that doesn’t have a phone or wouldn’t use it?

For instance, in [Malawi](https://dai-global-digital.com/digital-insights-malawi-communication-among-rural-communities.html) we found that older women were likely to express they had access to a phone, but when we dug deeper, we found that they have occasional use of their grandson’s mobile phone – for example – but on his terms and with his oversight. 

So we really don’t [leave anyone behind](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/leaving-no-one-behind-our-promise/leaving-no-one-behind-our-promise), we need to make sure we never implement tools with universal access as an assumption.
