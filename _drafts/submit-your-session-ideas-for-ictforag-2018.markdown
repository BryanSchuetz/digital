At ICTforAg 2018, we’ll seek answers to the real challenges faced by smallholder farmers, private sector actors, and government agricultural stakeholders in three focus areas:

## Which Market Systems Improve Farmer Livelihoods?

* Who is succeeding with digital financial services and what are they learning?
* How can we support local innovators and entrepreneurs?
* Which approaches build trust between farmers and value chain actors?
* When do market information systems increase farmer revenues?
* Where can private sector actors add real social and economic value?
* How can we better address gender dynamics to improve farmer outcomes?
* How can technological innovation change farming outcomes?

## Which New Tools Allow Farmers to Access and Understand Big Data?

* How can digital identity systems increase farmers’ access to services?
* When do farmers benefit from GIS and spatial data collected by others?
* Where are the practical use cases for blockchain and machine learning?
* Why and how does technology often exacerbate existing gender divides?
* Where can Crisis Response processes and tools increase farmer resilience?

## Where are the fragile environments, and how can farmers better assess risks?

* When can technologies support farmer response to political instability and conflict?
* Which innovations can reduce the impact of non-native pests?
* How can new approaches accelerate climate change adaptation?
* Who are the next generation of farmers, and how can we engage them?
