As a well-established implementer with decades of deep development expertise, one of the ways that DAI brings new solutions to both emerging and persistent global challenges is by partnering with innovators to invest in promising solutions. Partnering with technology startups that align with our mission allows us to leverage the power of technology and entrepreneurship and bring them to bear on global development challenges. It also keeps our work fresh and exciting!

In 2016, for example, we invested in four technology startups through our ‘[Innovation into Action Challenge](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-and-partners-launch-innovation-action-challenge)’, including ed-tech startup [Laboratoria](https://www.laboratoria.la/en), renewable energy enterprise [Solar Sister](https://solarsister.org/), and m-health platforms [ClickMedix](https://clickmedix.com/) and [ThinkMD](http://www.thinkmd.org/). Earlier this year, we [announced](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-global-health-invests-in-mhealth-leader-clickmedix) a further investment in ClickMedix. We’ve even invested in Ghanaian startups who came out of the [Kosmos Innovation Center](https://dai-global-digital.com/new-cda-insights-publication-building-the-future-of-tech-enabled-agriculture.html). Keeping with this tradition, DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration is extremely pleased to announce that we’ve entered a strategic partnership with our friends and colleagues at [Skilllab](https://skilllab.io/).

Skilllab is a technology startup founded in Amsterdam 2018 by Managing Director Ulrich Scharf that aims to create a more personalized and data-driven approach to career development and job placement, especially for marginalized populations. Using tailored artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, they profile the skills of marginalized people in the labor force and match them to career and education opportunities that align with their skill sets. Over the last year and a half, their efforts have focused on migrants and refugees in Europe [partnering with local and national authorities](http://www.eurocities.eu/eurocities/news/The-Skilllab-startup-calls-for-partner-cities-to-test-innovative-app-for-labour-market-integration-WSPO-B4KJMN) in the Netherlands, Belgium, Finland, Greece and the UK, earning recognition as a best [practice implementer of the European Skills, Competencies and Qualifications framework (ESCO)](https://ec.europa.eu/esco/portal/news/641c89b9-bd74-4be6-9d69-5d3761d658c2), but their technology is applicable in labor markets around the world.

## The Global Challenge

Globalization, digitization, automation, climate change, and migration - all of these are long-term trends that directly affect labor markets struggling to cope with the breakneck pace of change. If education and labor markets don’t rapidly adapt, countless communities risk losing sustainable livelihoods. In particular, marginalized groups such as refugees, migrants and internally displaced persons face the biggest challenges:

* Language barriers make it difficult to convey experience and skills

* Diversity of experiences can make it difficult for employers and career services to grasp a person’s skill set

* Labor market complexity makes it difficult to situate a person’s skill set into a specific market and its opportunities

These challenges are hardly isolated to migrant jobseekers in Europe -- we see them in places all over the world where DAI manages workforce development and economic growth projects.

## The Solution

To help address the challenge faced by transient job-seekers, Skilllab has developed a mobile application that plays the role of a local career counselor. The app uses AI to perform a comprehensive skill and knowledge assessment of the user based on a growing data model of over 13 thousand unique skills. In real time, the application automatically generates detailed skill profiles which match a user’s skill set to nearly 3,000 unique occupations, while also highlighting opportunities for upskilling. Already available in 27 languages, the mobile application can be used by job-seekers wherever they are, in their native language and automatically generate professionally designed skill profiles in any of the available languages.

Most importantly, the engaging app allows for this critical skills data to equip labour market actors from employers to public services with the up-to-date information needed to absorb, develop, and update the skills of their labor force.

Its innovative technology and approach has earned the company international recognition - recently being named as a [winner of the inaugural Google AI Impact Challenge](https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-org/ai-impact-challenge-grantees/) for organisations using AI to address societal challenges. Just one and a half years old, Skilllab has piloted its technology across cities working to integrate migrant labour in Europe and looks to bring its approach to new geographies.

## The CDA-Skilllab Partnership

Like most young relationships, the CDA-Skillab partnership is still evolving, but our main focus will be to bring this capability to new clients and geographic settings, combining Skilllab’s product development skills with CDA’s experience working with local communities as well as policy makers in emerging digital markets around the world. In addition to pursuing these growth opportunities together, we’re also keen to combine our software and app-building chops to co-develop products and services that meet the needs of job-seekers in a fast-paced, global marketplace.
