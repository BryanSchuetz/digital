The [Digital Frontiers](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df) project is issuing an expression of interest (EOI) to support the U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) **Democracy, Human Rights and Governance (DRG) office’s Responding to Digital Threats activity**.

In the 21st century, digital tools increasingly are becoming irreplaceable assets for societies. While digital tools offer an unprecedented opportunity for vulnerable, underserved, and unserved populations to access information and services, they also expose people, organizations, and countries to risks – for instance, the incitement of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar through digital platforms like Facebook, the manipulation of electoral discourse through the spread of disinformation in places like Ukraine, Brazil, and Vietnam, and the reverberating effects of massive ransomware attacks felt in high, middle, and low-income countries alike. These trends pose a threat to rule-of-law, democratic process, and human rights world-wide. In particular, China is exporting to other countries an internet governance model that conflicts with U.S. values of promoting an open, interoperable, free, and secure internet and democratic norms.

In support of DRG, Digital Frontiers seeks to identify qualified firms and/or consultants, including researchers, practitioners, and organizations with expertise in one or more of the following: **Elections cybersecurity, cybersecurity and democracy, artificial intelligence, algorithmic accountability, data privacy, surveillance technology, biometric IDs, and digital authoritarianism.**

Selected firms or consultants will provide services to assist and strengthen USAID’s DRG office in expanding their knowledge and understanding of internet governance and digital threats, as well as creating responsive resources on these topics. This includes building the capacity of USAID’s DRG office to identify digital threats and mitigate risks, organizing expert convenings, and supporting the USAID DRG office in effectively operationalizing and integrating recommendations into current and future programs.
