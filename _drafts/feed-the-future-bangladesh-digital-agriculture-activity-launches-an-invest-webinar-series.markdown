“One of the key guiding principles of business accelerators in commercializing AgTech services is to ensure entrepreneurs ‘get out of the building’, meet with customers, partners, and users to understand what roles they can play in scaling a business venture,” said Dipika Chawla in her speech. It is also essential for technology companies to realize that users and customers could be separate groups. For example, users could be farmers, whereas customers could be chemical fertilizer companies, governments, and other stakeholders. Business Accelerators could support such ventures to design their propositions and validate business models to better work with customers to support their user needs.

The panelists discussed how business accelerators could offer structured support beyond funding for early-stage AgTech ventures. Structured support to help entrepreneurs market test their products and services before launching and connecting them with local and international markets, business partners, and offering mentorship and networking opportunities is key to establishing a position in the ecosystem. While at growth stage, the impact investors and venture capitalists could handhold high-growth ventures whose business models envision solving the most pressing user needs.

Sharawwat Islam, highlighted how the piloting services offered by the Activity could complement and de-risk the investors’ services. She emphasized that the piloting support of the Activity could provide credible user testing information of the Agtech solutions for sound investment decisions and ensure the sustainability of the tools in the long run.

Several innovative financing solutions from UNCDF were discussed by Sakshi Chadha, which could help to scale AgTech solutions. Currently, AgTech solutions are considered high risk business models by traditional financiers, thus limiting the solutions’ growth by lack of access to finance. Through Bridge Facility, UNCDF provides financing facilities that are too small for commercial and development banks and too large for micro-finance institutions.

The Activity plans to do a few of these webinars. These series of dialogues and webinars aims to identify and facilitate linkages between promising AgTech tool owners and potential investors to support the long-term sustainability of scalable digital agriculture tools and technologies.
