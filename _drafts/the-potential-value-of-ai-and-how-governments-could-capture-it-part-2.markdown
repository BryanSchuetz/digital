## Possible opportunities for governments to help capture this potential
Governments can potentially play an active and critical role in capturing the many benefits of implementing AI technology across a country. They can choose from a variety of approaches, depending on factors such as local political and economic structures. And when these approaches are applied to different sectors or countries, there may be unique challenges to navigate. Based on our benchmark analysis of early adopters of AI technologies, we have identified several example initiatives.

## Enabling a vibrant AI ecosystem
Countries may consider creating an AI sector or ecosystem consisting of skilled practitioners, research institutes, start-ups, and large enterprises. Five enablers can be helpful in creating a vibrant AI ecosystem that has the potential to unlock benefits for citizens, businesses, and government entities: AI regulations; a highly skilled workforce; globally recognized, cutting-edge research and innovation; a combination of domestic and foreign funding; and world-class data and computer infrastructure. Of course, these enablers require planning and resources to attain and are not guaranteed to have impact. Globally, governments have spearheaded initiatives across the enablers:
* **Regulations**. Given the quickly evolving security, privacy, and ethical risks related to the use of AI, governments may consider establishing a systematic approach to actively watch for and potentially even penalize organizations that do not effectively identify and manage the risks associated with AI. In 2021, the European Union became the first governmental body in the world to issue [comprehensive draft regulations](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/what-the-draft-european-union-ai-regulations-mean-for-business) aimed specifically at the development and use of AI.9 These regulations suggest that organizations should have robust processes in place to manage AI risks and comply with existing and future regulations. Rather than scaling back on AI development, organizations may need to create a framework for risk management and compliance that will enable them to continue to innovate and deploy AI at a safe pace. Additionally, governments may want to define regulations on managing citizen data to the highest international data privacy standards, following guidelines from entities such as the United Nations.
* **Workforce**. To build talent broadly in the population, Finland launched [Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com/) in 2018—a free online course designed to introduce AI basics to nonspecialists in the public. As the course was published, the Finnish government pledged to educate at least 1 percent of its population—a target that was quickly met and surpassed. The course is now available in more than 20 languages, and 750,000 people around the globe have completed it. Similarly, AI Singapore has launched [LearnAI](https://learn.aisingapore.org/), a program that provides customized training courses targeted at various segments of society, including students, educators, industry professionals, and the larger public.
* **Research and innovation**. The National Science Foundation in the United States founded multiple National Artificial Intelligence Research Institutes focusing on a variety of AI themes, and the US government [announced](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/articles/trump-administration-investing-1-billion-research-institutes-advance-industries-future/) $1 billion in grant awards to create 12 [new AI and quantum information R&D institutes](https://venturebeat.com/business/white-house-announces-creation-of-ai-and-quantum-research-institutes/). Likewise, [AI Singapore’s ](https://aisingapore.org/research/)AI research grants provide up to 1 million Singapore dollars (about US $718,000) in funding to researchers focused on advanced AI to seed high-quality research efforts aimed at developing fundamental novel AI techniques, algorithms, and adjacent technologies.
* **Funding**. [UK Research and Innovation](https://www.ukri.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/UKRI-120221-TransformingOurWorldWithAI.pdf) has committed to providing £530 million of funding for AI research and development, comprising £129 million for novel AI algorithms, tools, and techniques and £401 million for the applications and implications of AI. AI Singapore’s flagship program, [100 Experiments](https://aisingapore.org/industryinnovation/100e/) (100E), aims to solve AI problem statements for entities across different sectors by providing about 250,000 Singapore dollars (roughly US $180,000) of funding per 100E project and giving access to a team of researchers and technical specialists.
* **Infrastructure**. Singapore has set up the [Centre of Excellence for Testing & Research of Autonomous Vehicles](https://cetran.sg/organisation/) (CETRAN) in collaboration with [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/erian/research-capabilities/centre-of-excellence-for-testing-research-of-autonomous-vehicles-ntu). At CETRAN, [emerging AI innovations](https://techxplore.com/news/2019-12-mock-skyscrapers-simulated-singapore-self-driving.html) such as autonomous vehicles can be tested in a sandbox environment that aims to replicate the different elements of Singapore’s roads with common traffic schemes, road infrastructure, and traffic rules. Similarly, in Taiwan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently [launched](https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=6&post=181407#:~:text=Taiwan%27s%20first%20autonomous%20minibus%20begins%20operations%20in%20Changhua,-July%2016%2C%202020&text=Taiwan%27s%20first%20indigenously%20developed%20self,the%20country%27s%20smart%20transportation%20sector.) the Unmanned Vehicles Technology Innovative Experimentation Program, which [licensed](https://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=J0030147) a company to conduct a [one-year experimental sandbox operation](https://www.intelligenttransport.com/transport-news/114324/winbus-taiwan/) for WinuBus, an electric, self-driving minibus.
