With the world’s catapult into a socially-distant reality earlier this year, donor-funded development projects have been forced to re-envision what it means to transfer knowledge, build capacity, and implement training courses for their staff, partners and beneficiaries. As a result, DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration has experienced a swell in requests to support the digital transformation of activities previously envisaged for in-person learning.

As we work to scale support to meet this rising demand, who better to consult on the topic than schoolteachers? Teachers around the world have been thrown into distance teaching with little notice and varied levels of preparation. This disruption triggered newfound – but long deserved – accolades for educators from parents suddenly face-to-face with their child’s learning curriculum. Surely anyone with the ability to persuade a 6-year old to follow instructions from 30 miles away is a someone worthy of our discipleship. So how did they do it and what did they learn? I spoke with elementary, middle, and high school teachers to glean their lessons learned for engaging learners at a distance. While they had much more to share on the matter, what I’m highlighting below are those most applicable to the field of international development.

## 5 Tips for Engaging Distant Learners

The advice below is primarily geared toward asynchronous learning experiences, that is, training content that is pre-prepared such that learners can work through the materials on their own time without a instructor or facilitator present. I recommend checking out this earlier post for [digital collaboration recommendations](https://568d4cf73aaede128400000b.preview.siteleaf.com/hosting-virtual-meetings-recommendations-from-a-six-week-veteran.html?utm_source=related-box) related to convening virtual workshops, trainings and other “live” remote events.

**1. Consider Learners’ Conditions for Distance Learning**
Before designing your distance learning or e-Learning course, understand the level of technology access and literacy among your target participants, as well as their home environment and constraints they might be facing. For example, when the Hmong charter school in Minnesota where Bob Mueller teaches transitioned to distance learning in March of this year, about 15% of his 6th graders were without internet access at home; others had to share computer time with siblings and other family members. As a result, Mr. Mueller prepared multiple lesson plans and communications mechanisms so that all students could be engaged in remote learning and planned interactive activities knowing only 50% of his class was likely to be online at a given time. To the contrary, at the international school in Japan where Aaron Alcodray serves as Personalized Learning Coordinator, the infrastructure was already largely in place for the transition to distance learning. High schoolers had internet access at home, were each in possession of a school-issued Macbook and were already comfortable navigating Edsby, the school’s online learning management system (LMS).

In addition to technology access, think about other conditions or constraints that might affect how or when learners will be able to engage. In the international development context we may ask: Are the trainees farmers who need to spend much of their daylight hours outside and away from a computer? Are they mothers juggling childcare along with their learning? Is email an effective means of communication in this context or do people prefer phone calls, SMS, or Whatsapp? Understanding these likely learner conditions and preferences will help you choose the best platform(s) for engagement, as well as inform your curriculum design in terms of duration and pacing.

**2. Rethink Your Approach**
Your initial instinct may be to take everything that you would otherwise do in the classroom and just do it online. This is a common pitfall and teachers quickly realized it wasn’t going to work. Learners don’t have the same attention span and access at home as they do in the classroom so “less is more”. Consider the constraints as well as new possibilities offered by the remote learning opportunity and be thoughtful about your content design. Mr. Alcodray advises, “as a teacher you have to reflect on what is absolutely necessary to achieve your learning objective; what is essential for your students to experience. This distance learning experience got everyone to pause and pare down to the most essential things to avoid burn-out for students and teachers alike.”\
For synchronous elements of distance learning, Mr. Alcodray also recommends teachers re-envision their role as facilitators of student understanding rather than distributors of knowledge. If students can do the learning experience (watch the video, read the article, etc.) on their own time, the limited time they have with their teacher can be spent on activities that apply their new knowledge and skills. In the education world this model is known as a “[flipped classroom](https://www.educationnext.org/the-flipped-classroom/)”.

**3. Keep Learning Interactive**
Non-synchronous learning does not have to mean non-interactive learning. You may consider a hybrid model that pairs real-time and self-paced course components or supplementing self-paced content with periodic check-ins or small group work. Group work can help learners feel connected, supported, and held accountable by their peers, while check-ins or “office hours” provide an opportunity for the instructor to answer questions, troubleshoot technology issues, or facilitate exercises for students to apply their learning.

Additionally, distance learning does not necessarily mean only staring at a computer screen. Mrs. Wageningen, a primary school teacher in the UK, advises “incorporating a mixture of media such as videos, audio, interactive computer programs, and practical tasks or activities using materials available in the home”. Mr. Mueller also noted that his students thrived with project-based learning that involved less direction and more creativity.  Even the best of us can lose focus when reading endless slides on a screen, so vary the method of content delivery and type of assignments you give to help keep learners interested and engaged.

**4. Provide Guidelines for Pacing and Time Management**
Depending on factors such as age, previous experience with remote learning, and cultural norms, learners may need support managing their time and pacing their e-learning content.  Jenny Larsen, a first-grade teacher in Minnesota, emphasized the importance of setting daily and weekly schedules for students to tackle their learning plan, emphasizing that “time management and procrastination are some of the hardest things to overcome. Give deadlines and encourage students to designate specific windows of time for certain tasks, writing out when they will start and stop, including when they will take breaks.”
Adult learners are not immune to procrastination and time mismanagement. Clearly communicate your expectations and deadlines and consider providing pacing guidance. Mr. Alcodray also noted the importance of teachers to be mindful of their time boundaries. When education transitions from the classroom to the digital realm, it is easy for teachers to constantly be “plugged in” and responsive to their students. For their own health and wellness, instructors should likewise set schedules that provide a separation between work and home.

**5. Evaluate and Adapt**
When Ms. Larsen sent out parent surveys two-weeks into distance learning, she learned her first-graders were struggling to pay attention for the duration of her online lessons and they were also missing the human connection with their teacher. This feedback allowed her to improve the students’ learning experience by shortening lessons and adding optional one-on-one “Read to Mrs. Larsen” time blocks to the weekly schedule. While it’s common in international development to collect feedback from participants after a workshop or training session, this is most often solicited via an end-of-activity evaluation. In the case of remote training delivery, if the learning style is new (such as during a global pandemic when swift adjustments are necessary) or the material is being delivered over an extended period of time, check in with participants throughout the course to evaluate their access to the materials, understanding of the content, and overall experience. Then use that feedback to provide better support for the remainder of the training. This might mean providing additional learning resources, shifting deadlines or expanding virtual “office hours”.

## So What Tech Tool Should I Use?

If you were hoping this post was going to tell you the best tech tool to use for delivering training content to your project’s trainees, I’m sorry to disappoint you. The teachers I spoke to cited numerous digital tools and platforms they found helpful for school-aged student engagement and learning management – such as Seesaw, G Suite, DB Primary, Screen Casitify, and Ed Puzzle – some of which they even plan to bring back into the classroom or use for snow day for substitute scenarios. However, identifying the right platform for your training will warrant careful consideration of a multitude of factors including the number of participants, learners’ level of technology access and literacy, training content and learning objectives, and budget. While I don’t have that answer for you, I hope you took away some helpful considerations for your future e-Learning or remote training needs!

*I’d like to extend a huge thank you to teachers everywhere, and special appreciation to those who shared their experiences and insights for the development of this post: Aaron Alcodray, Jenny Arnfelt, Jessica Listerud, Bob Mueller, and Christina van Wageringen.*
