With the world’s catapult into a socially-distant reality earlier this year, donor-funded development projects have been forced to re-envision what it means to transfer knowledge, build capacity, and implement training courses for their staff, partners and beneficiaries. As a result, DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration has experienced a swell in requests to support the digital transformation of activities previously envisaged for in-person learning. 

As DAI works to scale support to meet this rising demand, who better to consult on this topic than schoolteachers? Teachers around the world have been thrown into distance teaching with little notice and varied levels of preparation. This disruption triggered newfound – but long deserved – accolades for educators from parents suddenly face-to-face with their child’s learning curriculum. Surely anyone with the ability to persuade a 6-year old to follow instructions from 30 miles away is a someone worthy of our discipleship. So how did they do it and what did they learn? I spoke with elementary, middle, and high school teachers to glean their lessons learned for engaging learners at a distance. While they had much more to share on the matter, what I’m highlighting below are those most applicable to the field of international development.

5 Tips for Engaging Distant Learners
The advice below is primarily geared toward asynchronous learning experiences, that is, training content that is pre-prepared such that learners can work through the materials on their own time without a instructor or facilitator present. I recommend checking out this earlier post for digital collaboration recommendations related to convening virtual workshops, trainings and other “live” remote events.

1. Consider participants’ conditions for distance learning
Before designing your distance learning or e-Learning course, understand the level of technology access and literacy among your target participants, as well as their home environment and constraints they might be facing. For example, when the Hmong charter school in Minnesota where Bob Mueller teaches transitioned to distance learning in March of this year, about 15% of his 6th graders were without internet access at home; others had to share computer time with siblings and other family members. As a result, Mr. Mueller prepared multiple lesson plans and communications mechanisms so that all students could be engaged in remote learning and planned interactive activities knowing only 50% of his class was likely to be online at a given time. To the contrary, at the international school in Japan where Aaron Alcodray serves as Personalized Learning Coordinator, the infrastructure was already largely in place for the transition to distance learning. High schoolers had internet access at home, were each in possession of a school-issued Macbook and were already comfortable navigating Edsby, the school’s online learning management system (LMS). 

In addition to technology access, think about other conditions or constraints that might affect how or when learners will be able to engage. In the international development context we may ask: Are the trainees farmers who need to spend much of their daylight hours outside and away from a computer? Are they mothers juggling childcare along with their learning? Is email an effective means of communication in this context or do people prefer phone calls, SMS, or Whatsapp? Understanding these likely learner conditions and preferences will help you choose the best platform(s) for engagement, as well as inform your curriculum design in terms of duration and pacing. 

2. Rethink Your Approach
Your initial instinct may be to take everything that you would otherwise do in the classroom and just do it online. This is a common pitfall and teachers quickly realized it wasn’t going to work. Learners don’t have the same attention span and access at home as they do in the classroom so “less is more”. Consider the constraints as well as new possibilities offered by the remote learning opportunity and be thoughtful about your content design. Mr. Alcodray advises, “as a teacher you have to reflect on what is absolutely necessary to achieve your learning objective; what is essential for your students to experience. This distance learning experience got everyone to pause and pare down to the most essential things to avoid burn-out for students and teachers alike.”  
For synchronous elements of distance learning, Mr. Alcodray also recommends teachers re-envision their role as facilitators of student understanding rather than distributors of knowledge. If students can do the learning experience (watch the video, read the article, etc.) on their own time, the limited time they have with their teacher can be spent on activities that apply their new knowledge and skills. In the education world this model is known as a “flipped classroom”. 

3. Keep learning interactive 
Non-synchronous learning does not have to mean non-interactive learning. You may consider a hybrid model that pairs real-time and self-paced course components or supplementing self-paced content with periodic check-ins or small group work. Group work can help learners feel connected, supported, and held accountable by their peers, while check-ins or “office hours” provide an opportunity for the instructor to answer questions, troubleshoot technology issues, or facilitate exercises for students to apply their learning. 

Additionally, distance learning does not necessarily mean only staring at a computer screen. Mrs. Wageningen, a primary school teacher in the UK, advises “incorporating a mixture of media such as videos, audio, interactive computer programs, and practical tasks or activities using materials available in the home”. Mr. Mueller also noted that his students thrived with project-based learning that involved less direction and more creativity.  Even the best of us can lose focus when reading endless slides on a screen, so vary the method of content delivery and type of assignments you give to help keep learners interested and engaged.
