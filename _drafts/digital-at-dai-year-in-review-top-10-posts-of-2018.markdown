This year Digital@DAI published more than 50 posts, covering everything from women’s entrepreneurship in Cambodia, to Cybersecurity for development, to smartphone apps for fisheries in Central America.

We featured digital experts from organizations such as [John’s Hopkins University](https://twitter.com/alabriqu), [Simprints](https://www.simprints.com/), [Every1Mobile](https://www.every1mobile.com/), [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://www.hotosm.org/) (HOT), and [Panoply Digital](https://www.panoplydigital.com/), and had almost 47,000 page views. We continue to explore the potential of digital technology across sectors, geographies, clients, and constituents in the blog and in the work that we do.  As we continue to engage with all of you, and with the ICT4D sector through DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration, our focus on research and products will expand and our field-focused work will drive towards responsible, inclusive and dynamic deployments of digital solutions in the countries where we operate.

In our [final blog of 2017](https://dai-global-digital.com/digital-at-dai-year-in-review-top-ten-posts-of-2017.html?utm_source=related-box) we reviewed the top 10 most read articles of the year. With our audience and total number of blog posts continuing to grow, we’ll look at our top 10 of 2018, which showcase a broad range of topics, content, and writers.  We hope you will connect with us, read the blog, and [subscribe](https://confirmsubscription.com/h/r/066AFBA15492935C) to Digital@DAI so that you won’t miss any of the posts we have in the works for 2019.

Stay tuned for what 2019 brings. We will continue to use this blog to investigate emerging trends in digital technologies for global development, hold conversations with some of the field’s foremost experts, and deliver informative and engaging content to you on a weekly basis.
