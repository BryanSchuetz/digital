“We are at an inflection point in digital development!” [Lauren Woodman](https://nethope.org/staff/lauren-woodman/), CEO of NetHope, boomed over the crowd of 750-plus participants the first day of the recent [ICT4D Conference](https://www.ict4dconference.org/) in Lusaka, Zambia. She went on to say that we have become good at getting to average, but we need to figure out where we go from here. [Chris Burns](https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/organization/christopher-burns), Acting Deputy Executive Director, U.S. Global Development Lab and Director, Center for Digital Development, USAID, similarly questioned the audience: “How do we make the full range of digital tools available to all?” He went on to ask how we build self-reliance through digital and work ourselves out of a job. Throughout the week, the conference rightfully stressed the importance of collaboration, big and responsible data use, emerging technologies, an inclusive digital economy, and much more.

At first, I was completely enthralled by the *kumbaya* nature of the conference. The conference brought together startups, tech companies, mobile network operators, governments, implementing organizations, faith-based groups, nongovernmental organizations, social enterprises, and students from around the world to discuss what we have achieved through ICT4D, what we can learn from others, and how we can look toward the future. But, the more time I spent, the more I wanted to get past the niceties. I’m less than a year into my job as an ICT Specialist at DAI’s newly launched [Center for Digital Acceleration ](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-launches-the-center-for-digital-acceleration)and I am already fully aware that ICT4D is not simple. While most actors share a common goal, the means of getting there has, and will continue to, create healthy disagreements, ones that should be unpacked in this kind of setting.

The second day more than met my expectations, especially at the session on\* Integrated Health Data and the Challenges of Data Ownership. \* I am not just pointing out this session because it was moderated by DAI’s [Digital Frontiers](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df)’ Project Director Katie Shipley, but rather because it unearthed some of the conflicting viewpoints related to this topic. To provide a bit of context, the concept of health data ownership asks questions such as:

* If data is collecting by a variety of actors, who legally owns the data?
* Who can access the data?
* Where is the data stored?
* Who is responsible for managing and securing the data?
* Who can interpret the data and whose interpretation of the data is correct?
* Who can use the data for decision-making?
* And, how do we build systems that can communicate and share data with one another?

These are not questions with easy answers, but they are questions that need to be answered if we want to we want to successfully use data to inform health programming and subsequently health outcomes. I have included a few of the points of contention that were brought up during this session below:

## Data Storage

Many governments are now enacting laws that prohibit the storage of government health data in servers outside the country. Panelist Virginia Simushi, Principal ICT Officer at the[ Zambia Ministry of Health](http://www.moh.gov.zm/), argued that although data is being collected by a variety of companies and individuals it should be stored in one central place: the Ministry of Health (MOH). As the MOH owns the data and is responsible for its security, this makes sense, but [Derek Treatment](http://vitalwave.com/team/derek-treatman/), Director of Technology Solutions at [Vital Wave](http://vitalwave.com/) made the point that often times servers in-country are actually less secure, reliable and affordable as cloud servers. Based on his experience working with the Ethiopia Ministry of Health, he suggested storing data in the cloud in the near term and transferring it to the national data system once effectively up and running. All panelists seemed to agree that the government should own and be able to access all health data collected in their country..

**Data Permission**
In her opening remarks, Ms. Simushi pointed out that there are a lot of partners collecting and sharing health data in Zambia and “sometimes they get permission and sometimes they do not.” She went on to request that all actors get permission to collect data before doing so. Panelist [Rosemary Muliokela](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosemary-k-muliokela-59a0b317/), mHealth Program Manager at the [World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/), reflected on her struggles working with telecoms and took Simushi’s request one step further, by recommending that any MOU between the MOH and partnering organizations define exactly how the data is used. Mr. Treatment then outlined a practical step—data sharing agreements, legal documents that describe what the data owner (MOH) is allowing the partner to do with the data. While the principle of “permission” was not a direct point of a contention on the panel, one audience member commented “to open data, you need to restrict it,” meaning that the process of getting permission will end up temporarily restricting partners look to collect and analyse data.

## Data Standards

When asked for concrete recommendations, panelist [Amy Paul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-paul-70276917/), Science and Technology Policy Fellow, [U.S. Global Development Lab](https://www.usaid.gov/GlobalDevLab/about), USAID, noted that health data ecosystems are extremely fragmented and called for coordination under a shared set of standards created and mandated by governments. This will make sure data is collected in an interoperable way, and analysed and shared properly. Ms. Muliokela also brought up the problem of siloed platforms that do not “talk to each other” calling for a MOH framework that guides implementers and sets expectations. Ms. Simushi agreed as a set of standards would force partners not to “stray outside the boundary of data they promised to collect.” In response, one audience member questioned the sustainability of interoperability, noting the technical limitations of having 14 different systems feed into one platform (DHIS2 in this case). Ms. Paul responded that the specifics of the minimum data sets for diseases should all be included in the standards to create a “national data dictionary”.  The problem is that without an enforcement mechanism these requirements will not fully take effect.

These issues have no right answers but I commend the ICT4D Conference for bringing various actors, such as the panelists in this discussion, together to collaborate and continue the important conversations around digital development.
