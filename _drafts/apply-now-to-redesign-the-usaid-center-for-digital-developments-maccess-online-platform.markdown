A digital ecosystem is the how and why users interact with government services, digital financial tools, and each other using mobile devices. A single data point alone may not tell the whole story for digital inclusion and how to best reach those in low-connectivity settings globally. To help address this challenge, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Center for Digital Development (CDD) developed the mAccess diagnostic site, an online tool for global decision makers to analyze the availability, cost of connectivity, and number of users for more than 100 countries. The mAccess tool was launched in early 2016 and has been shared across USAID.

Today, [Digital Frontiers](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df) releases a request for proposals (RFP) to redesign and administer the mAccess online platform diagnostic tool to increase its use and value within USAID. Staff from USAID’s CDD team and Digital Frontiers will work closely with the selected contractor to design and implement a redesigned mAccess online platform. The contractor will lead the redesign process including: visioning, redesign and testing, website hosting, administration, and support with input and approval of USAID and Digital Frontiers. 

We anticipate awarding this opportunity as time and materials or cost reimbursable contract.
