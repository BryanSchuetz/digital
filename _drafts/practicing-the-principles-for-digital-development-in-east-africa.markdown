*This is a guest post by Mustapha Issa, Field Manager and MAST Coordinator and Gilead Mushaija, GIS-Database Specialist, both from DAI's [Feed the Future Land Tenure Assistance project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/tanzania-feed-future-tanzania-land-tenure-assistance-lta)*

At the recent [Practicing the Principles for Digital Development](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/practicing-the-principles-for-digital-development-in-east-africa-tickets-37822273438) on October 12th in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, 80 participants from organizations such as DAI, The Ministry of Works, Transport and Communications and private organizations in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Malawi attended.

The [Digital Impact Alliance](https://digitalimpactalliance.org/) (DIAL) and the [Human Development Innovation Fund Tanzania](http://www.hdif-tz.org/) (HDIF-UKAid) stewarded the event and were joined by leading organizations in endorsing the Digital Principles, including USAID. DAI is a [signatory to the Principles](https://digitalprinciples.org/endorse/endorsers/).

The [Principles for Digital Development](https://digitalprinciples.org/) are nine living guidelines designed to help development practitioners integrate best practices into technology-enabled programs. These principles are:

* Design with the User

* Understanding the Existing Ecosystem

* Design for Scale

* Build for Sustainability

* Be Data Driven

* Use Open Standards, Open Data, Open Source and Open Innovation

* Reuse and Improve

* Address Privacy and Security

* Be Collaborative

## Discussed Principles:

Participants focused on three principles and will focus on three more on 7th December in Washington DC, USA while focusing on the final three in Asia at an event to be confirmed.  At the Dar event, they discussed the following:

**1. Principle No. 9 - Be Collaborative:**

A plenary discussion and interactive group session was done where all the participants had chance to discuss the challenges and successes of how to collaborate across the private and public sectors. Emphasis was on collaborating between donors and partners and the government institutions to be involved in projects so as to meet the desired goals as one team and addressing the challenges and their solutions.

**2. Principle No. 1 - Design with the User:**

This session included insightful lightning talks on how organizations have designed with the user in mind. It is crucial to design with the users before implementing programs so as to address the challenges before designing; practitioners must incorporate multiple user types and stakeholders in each phase of the project lifestyle. Examples discussed included land formalization projects like DAI’s USAID-funded [Land Tenure Assistance project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/tanzania-feed-future-tanzania-land-tenure-assistance-lta) where information is being captured using MAST software in mobile phones. Another example was the World Bank’s mapping projects in Tanzania which are using Humanitarian Open Street Map. Our key takeaway was to embrace an iterative process that allows for incorporating feedback and adopting your solutions.

**3. Principle No. 2: Understand the Ecosystem:**

Understanding the existing ecosystem is critical to inform how digital development programs are designed, implemented and monitored. To understand stakeholders in digital ecosystems, we need to engage with target users to ensure that the proposed digital initiative aligns with the existing technological, legal and regulatory policies. Involvement of community members, local and Central government, donors and other implementing organizations is equally crucial, as is continued monitoring of the ecosystem for changes.

## What is the Future of Digital Development in East Africa?

It has been noted that the combination of all of the principles for digital development’s implementation will accelerate the sustainable future of digital development in East Africa. A slogan used here is: “If you want to go fast, go alone; If you want to far, go together!” In Tanzania, internet connectivity is 40% in the country while people with mobile phones are approximated to be 80% of the whole population. The future of digital development in Tanzania promises to be very positive in the near future as the internet connectivity will be increased and mobile phones ownership increasing as well. The process of moving from paper based documentation to paperless documentation is ongoing on a fast rate. In the land sector, LTA is a valid example of this initiative of registration of land rights using MAST software in mobile phones and having the information stored on a centralized database for future use of the country. The scaling up of this project is expected to be adopted in the whole country for registration of land rights in rural areas at very reasonable costs.

The [Digital Principles forum](http://forum.digitalprinciples.org) was launched to keep conversation going after the event; you can also logon to connect with fellow digital development practitioners through this interactive platform.
