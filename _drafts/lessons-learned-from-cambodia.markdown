How do you get Cambodian girls [interested](http://www.development-innovations.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Factors-Affecting-Women-Engaging-in-Tech-Careers-in-Cambodia-Report.pdf) and involved in Cambodia’s tech sector to address the digital gender divide? This is a question that the six-year, USAID-funded [Development Innovations (DI) project](https://www.development-innovations.org/) has been wrestling with since its inception—and that [CDA](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/digital-acceleration) and DI have [regularly](https://dai-global-digital.com/defeated-by-the-digital-divide-invest-in-inclusion.html) [chronicled](https://dai-global-digital.com/powering-women-entrepreneurs-in-cambodia.html) on their [blogs](https://www.development-innovations.org/?s=technovation). In 2014, DI launched Technovation in Cambodia with only one team, in coordination with the global tech entrepreneurship non-profit Technovation Global. [Technovation](https://technovationchallenge.org/) is an annual 12-week global coding and business plan competition for girls and young women aged 10-18. Each week, the girls (also known as mentees) work closely with a set of business and technical mentors to develop a mobile application and associated business plan that addresses a problem in their community.

Over the past six years, Technovation has become wildly popular in Cambodia: over 800 girls in three provinces have learned how to code, 15 Cambodian teams have made it to Technovation’s global semi-finals, and two Cambodian teams have traveled to Silicon Valley in California to pitch at the finals of the Technovation World Pitch. Just last month, [a Cambodian team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMS6Hoox3k0) placed[ second in the world](https://www.technovation.org/blogs/technovation-awards-nearly-30000-usd-to-teams-from-albania-and-india-in-global-girls-tech-competition/) in the junior division!

Now that the DI project is coming to an end, the DI and CDA teams are thinking through and chronicling some of the biggest successes and biggest challenges coming from DI’s support to Technovation Cambodia. To look at Technovation Cambodia from all angles, we conducted 30\+ stakeholder interviews in Phnom Penh and Battambang in August 2019.

## Successes Achieved

So, what went well?

* **Technovation Cambodia helped Cambodian girls develop soft skills, not only tech skills.** When asked the most important skills and knowledge that mentees gained from participating in Technovation, 100% of mentees and over 90% of parents and mentors talked about soft skills, specifically critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership skills. This helps fill a gap identified by leaders throughout the the Cambodian educational systems.

* **Technovation is a global competition, and Cambodian girls are succeeding on the world stage.** The fact that 15 Cambodian teams have made it to the semi-finals of the World Pitch and two teams have competed in the World Pitch finals in the past four years is a highly symbolic for several high-level strategic stakeholders. It provides concrete evidence that Cambodian students can compete at a global level and helps Cambodians at home cultivate a sense of confidence and pride in their country.

* **Technovation Cambodia is achieving organic growth – schools are taking the initiative to start their own Technovation clubs.** Since 2018, three new schools or organizations in Phnom Penh and Battambang province have taken the initiative to start and manage their own Technovation clubs. One of these schools has even incorporated Technovation into its official school curriculum. This shows that there is a local need and desire for a tech education program like Technovation, even without DI’s existence or support, and bodes well for the sustainability of the Technovation Cambodia model even after DI ends.

* **Technovation strengthens Cambodia’s tech ecosystem and builds alliances among major stakeholders.** Technovation facilitates networking among Technovation mentors, helping them build connections that extend into their professional lives. At a higher level, this creates new relationships within Cambodia’s tech sector that may not have existed otherwise and which reinforce Cambodia’s tech sector. At the same time, Technovation brings together previously disparate high-profile stakeholders – like the donor community, major private companies, and the national government – in support of a common cause while also helping them achieve other goals, like creating linkages with the local tech ecosystem.

## Challenges Faced

Just as importantly—what did not go as well?

* **Persistent communication challenges create confusion for Technovation stakeholders.** Mentors, mentees, and parents consistently report not having the right information at the right time from Technovation Cambodia. This is a two-fold problem: not only did interviewees report an occasional lack of information or inconsistent information on things like session start times (the day-to-day operational level), they also reported not understanding why fundamental changes to Technovation Cambodia took place (at the higher strategic level). This is in part a challenge because many mentees do not have their own email or Facebook accounts, and use parents or schools as interlocutors. Over time, the Technovation community often used closed Facebook groups to organize events, and more often than not, made individual phone calls. The lesson here,  is that it critical to know your “users” here, and ensure internal communication strategies are just as strong as the public-facing communications strategy. However, whenever Technovation stakeholders sought out DI staff or consultants with questions or clarifications, they reported that help was always accessible and the Technovation team answered questions quickly.

* **Technovation’s required time commitment is a key barrier to attracting and retaining mentors and mentees.** At minimum, Technovation requires half a Sunday from mentors and mentees for twelve weeks. In reality, this typically translates to near-daily work for closer to six months. This makes it hard to attract high-quality mentors and mentees. For example, on the mentee side, several former mentees said that they stopped participating in Technovation once they reached Year 9 or Year 12 because they needed to devote more time to studying for their national exams. It also makes mentor retention a problem during the Technovation season. In 2018, about 60% of mentors dropped out after just four weeks. This had a ripple effect on mentees as well—only about 50 percent of girls who started in Week 1 submitted to Technovation Global 12 weeks later.

* **Mentor commitment is both critical and inconsistent.** At its core, Technovation is a mentorship program, the success of which is driven by the relationship between mentor and mentee. Negative experiences with their mentors color the quality of Technovation experience for mentees. A number of mentees noted that their mentors were not well-prepared each week. Several mentors also missed multiple sessions throughout the twelve weeks, though some did mention that say that they made up the time with their mentees during the week. A key piece of feedback on a feedback survey from the 2018 Technovation alumni was to bring in more dedicated mentors.

* **Different groups of Technovation participants and stakeholders require different types of support.** When Technovation Cambodia first began, DI worked with a relatively homogeneous group of mentees from NGO-run and private schools. However, as Technovation has [expanded to new schools and new provinces,](https://www.development-innovations.org/blog/the-evolution-of-technovation-cambodia-2014-2019/) its participant base has grown, segmented, and their needs diversified. Community-based organizations in rural Battambang province are now participating in Technovation Cambodia, alongside schools in Phnom Penh. Younger participants may need additional support from their mentors that is appropriate to their developmental level, while less affluent students from public schools may not have access to equipment outside their Technovation sessions. It is good for Cambodia that Technovation is expanding, though this does make it more difficult for Technovation organizers to support these new stakeholders accordingly.

Donor-funded programs focused on technology are new and evolving quickly. By sharing our lessons learned—both positive and negative—about a signature program activity, we hope to encourage other tech ecosystem strengthening projects to do the same. A public evidence base will only help this type of project thrive in the future.
