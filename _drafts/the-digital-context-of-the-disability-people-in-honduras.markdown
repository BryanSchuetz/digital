The number of people with a disability in Latin America and the Caribbean between 2001-2013 was estimated at more than [70 million](https://www.paho.org/hon/index.php?option=com_docman&view=download&alias=383-identificacion-y-caracterizacion-de-las-personas-con-discapacidad-en-francisco-morazan-2017&category_slug=fortalecimiento-de-sistemas-de-salud&Itemid=211) (or 12.5% ​​of the total regional population, 12.6% of the population from Latin America and 6.1% of the Caribbean countries).

In Honduras, studies on this community are scarce and limited. According to the results of the Permanent Survey of Households with Multiple Purposes of the National Statistics Institute (INE) carried out in September 2002, found that Honduras has a population 177,516 people with disabilities. However, more recent studies \[2013 INE Census\] found that the number was much hire, estimated at 205,423 people. [Academic studies](http://www.bvs.hn/Honduras/UICFCM/Articulo3_Vol83-1-2-Discapacidad.Sujetos.18-65a.pdf) find that the number of people in Honduras with a disability is even hire at 381,287 people. A lack of clarity on how many people live with disabilities in the country, prevents the government from effectively thinking through how to design services to be inclusive of that population.

In 2009, the judiciary of that country in its modernization plan pointed out the existence of problems of [access to information](http://www.poderjudicial.gob.hn/transparencia/planeacion/documents/PlandeModernizaci%C3%B3nPoderJudicial200420091.pdf), which is concentrated in Tegucigalpa, it is indicated that there are no means to access or disseminate it, The inclusion mechanisms of disabled populations are not mentioned in this plan.

The USAID [Justicia, Derechos Humanos y Seguridad de Honduras](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/honduras-united-for-justice) known as “United for Justice” works to improve access to justice for vulnerable populations. With the publication of a strategic plan for the government to modernize its justice system, the project saw an opportunity to study how the disabled population could leverage digital tools to facilitate access the justice system. To do this, the project began by conducting Frontiers Insights®, DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration, to obtain baseline data of how the disable population currently uses digital tools and services in their everyday lives. A sample of 310 people with disabilities were interviewed as part of this study. These individuals live in San Pedro Sula, Tela, and La Ceiba.

## More access than expected but little knowledge of the law

The findings of the study highlighted what digital access looks like for this population. We found that:

* **In general, 85% have a mobile phone**, 72% owns a smartphone which is high compared to the average in Honduras. According to the GSMA connectivity index only 52.7% have a Smartphone.

* **85% of phone users own an Android smartphone**, 14% have a basic phone and 8% have an iPhone (some have both an iPhone and an Android).

*  **Hearing impaired people use smartphones (95%)** at a higher rate than other groups of people with disabilities, followed by visually impaired (82%), physically disabled (78%), psychosocially disabled (73 %), intellectually disabled (67%) and amputees (65%).

* People with intellectual disabilities are the most likely **not to own a mobile phone (50%)**, followed by people with multiple disabilities (12%).

* **The vast majority do not share their phone**, although people with low levels of education tend to share and borrow their phones at a higher than average rate in Honduras.

* The p**robability of having a mobile phone falls** as people reach 50 years of age in all demographic groups.

* The applications that people with disabilities in Honduras **uses the most** are Facebook, WhatsApp and Messenger as well as support applications specific to their disability.

From the Frontiers Insights® study we also found some important insights on how the disability population in Honduras accesses the justice system. We found that:

* · Only 35% of the people interviewed are aware of the Honduran law for people with disabilities. Depending on the disability this awareness ranged. For instance, people with intellectual disabilities were the least aware of the legal system at 14%. In comparison, those with physical or visual disabilities were more aware with 50% of those interviewed acknowledging that they were aware of the laws.

· Only 24% of the people interviewed believe that the government and private sector respect them, but responses depended on the disability. Those that felt they were most respected were people who are hearing impaired (41%) or with an intellectual disability (44%).

· In contrast, people with physical (13%), psychosocial (13%) and visual (8%) disabilities perceived significantly less respect for their disability in all sectors.

## Result of the Frontiers Insights® in Honduras

Mobile technologies are widely used by people with disabilities in Honduras, which presents an opportunity to increase their access to services like the justice system. With this baseline of data, the United for Justice project or a future project working to increase access to any service for the disability population in Honduras.

This study would not have been possible, without the support of Mr. Adam Fivenson and the entire technical and administrative team of the USAID [Justicia, Derechos Humanos y Seguridad de Honduras](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/honduras-united-for-justice) project.
