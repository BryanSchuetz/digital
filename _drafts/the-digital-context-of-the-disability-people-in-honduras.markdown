In Honduras, studies on how many people live in the country with a disability are scarce . According to the results of the Permanent Survey of Households with Multiple Purposes of the National Statistics Institute (INE) carried out in September 2002, found that Honduras has a population 177,516 people with disabilities. However, more recent studies \[2013 INE Census\] found that the number was much higher, estimated at 205,423 people. [Academic studies](http://www.bvs.hn/Honduras/UICFCM/Articulo3_Vol83-1-2-Discapacidad.Sujetos.18-65a.pdf) tel a different story. They estimate that the number of people in Honduras with a disability is closer to 381,287 people. These differing reports, demonstrate that the Honduras has limited clarity on how many people within their country have a disability, therefore preventing the government, institutions, or civil society from  effectively thinking through how ensure that services are accessible to people with disabilities.

USAID's [Justicia, Derechos Humanos y Seguridad de Honduras](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/honduras-united-for-justice) known as “United for Justice” works to improve access to justice for vulnerable populations, including people with disabilities. As part of Honduras's commitment to [modernize](http://www.poderjudicial.gob.hn/transparencia/planeacion/documents/PlandeModernizaci%C3%B3nPoderJudicial200420091.pdf) its judiciary system, United for Justice saw an opportunity to assess how people with disabilities currently access justice and how they might be able to access justice through digital tools in the future.  

Nationally, Honduras's mobile penetration levels are average, with about 50% of the population owning a mobile phone. The question then was, did this number adequately reflect the level of mobile penetration in the disabled community? To find out, the project team in collaboration with DAI's Center for Digital Acceleration conducted   Frontiers Insights® a rapidly deployable, in-person research method to obtain baseline of how the disable population currently uses digital tools and services in their everyday lives. A sample of 310 people with disabilities were interviewed as part of this study. These individuals live in San Pedro Sula, Tela, and La Ceiba.

## More access than expected but little knowledge of the law

During the study we found some enlightening insights as to what digital tools and services the disabled population in Honduras use. We found that:

* **85% own a mobile phone**,  72% of which are smartphones. This is high in comparison to the average in Honduras, where the mobile penetration rate is[ 52.7% ](http://www.mobileconnectivityindex.com/#year=2018&zoneIsocode=HND&analysisView=HND).

* **85% of phone users own an Android smartphone**, 14% have a basic phone and 8% have an iPhone (some have both an iPhone and an Android).

*  **Hearing impaired people use smartphones (95%)** at a higher rate than other groups of people with disabilities, followed by visually impaired (82%), physically disabled (78%), psychosocially disabled (73 %), intellectually disabled (67%) and amputees (65%).

* People with intellectual disabilities are the most likely **not to own a mobile phone (50%)**, followed by people with multiple disabilities (12%).

* **The vast majority do not share their phone**, although people with low levels of education tend to share and borrow their phones at a higher than average rate in Honduras.

* The p**robability of having a mobile phone falls** as people reach 50 years of age in all demographic groups.

* The applications that people with disabilities in Honduras **uses the most** are Facebook, WhatsApp and Messenger as well as support applications specific to their disability.

From the Frontiers Insights® study we also found some important insights on how the disability population in Honduras accesses the justice system. We found that:

* Only 35% of the people interviewed are aware of the Honduran law for people with disabilities. Depending on the disability this awareness ranged. For instance, people with intellectual disabilities were the least aware of the legal system at 14%. In comparison, those with physical or visual disabilities were more aware with 50% of those interviewed acknowledging that they were aware of the laws.

* Only 24% of the people interviewed believe that the government and private sector respect them, but responses depended on the disability. Those that felt they were most respected were people who are hearing impaired (41%) or with an intellectual disability (44%).

* In contrast, people with physical (13%), psychosocial (13%) and visual (8%) disabilities perceived significantly less respect for their disability in all sectors.

## Result of the Frontiers Insights® in Honduras

Mobile technologies are widely used by people with disabilities in Honduras, which presents an opportunity to increase their access to services like the justice system. With this baseline of data, the United for Justice project or a future project working to increase access to any service for the disability population in Honduras.

This study would not have been possible, without the support of Adam Fivenson and the entire technical and administrative team of the USAID [Justicia, Derechos Humanos y Seguridad de Honduras](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/honduras-united-for-justice) project.
