As the COVID-19 [pandemic](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/11/health/coronavirus-pandemic-world-health-organization/index.html) makes its way across the globe, and even well-resourced health systems struggle with the availability of critical supplies needed to treat patients, a number of initiatives have emerged in the hardware community looking to help solve the shortage of physical supplies.

When looking to bring the supply chain for critical goods closer to where they are needed in emergencies, [Field Ready](https://www.fieldready.org/) is the organization that first comes to mind. No newcomer, Field Ready has more certified open source hardware designs than any other organization, and many of the items in its [catalogue](https://airtable.com/shrqwRqxAVvaF1q4z/tblJv98WkMMsgDRiE/viwQARb0J2MZZQ2GH?blocks=hide)—like its Air Pollution Face Mask, Oxygen Supply Fitting, Ventilator Connector, and other designs—could be useful for frontline health workers running low on critical items during this pandemic. Some designs are 3D-printable and some come complete with Ikea-style wordless assembly instructions.

A main cause for concern globally, is the lack of available ventilators to meet demand of sick patients. We’ve seen this in [Italy](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-draegerwerk-ventil/germany-italy-rush-to-buy-life-saving-ventilators-as-manufacturers-warn-of-shortages-idUSKBN210362). The hardware community is attempting to take on this massive challenge too and in surprising ways. Facebook groups are not a typical platform for collaboration in the hardware community, but the [Open Source COVID19 Medical Supplies](https://www.facebook.com/groups/670932227050506/about/) group on Facebook includes many of the brightest in the hardware community and is making furious progress toward developing open source ventilator designs. They’re not the only ones. A [variety of other ventilator projects](https://www.notechmagazine.com/2020/03/open-source-breathing-ventilators-covid19.html) underway.

As of writing, Italy remains a hotspot for COVID-19 cases. Often underappreciated, particularly by Americans, as a center for design and manufacturing genius, Italians themselves are taking on the challenge to minimize the ventilator shortage. For example, a Milan Fab Lab is leveraging the regions manufacturing talent and infrastructure to design and produce 3D printed replacements for a ventilator valve that was in critically short supply. According to reports, [ten patients](https://www.3dprintingmedia.network/covid-19-3d-printed-valve-for-reanimation-device/) are currently breathing with the help of these 3D-printed valves.

In the U.S., [fears of ventilator shortages](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/nyregion/ny-coronavirus-ventilators.html) are also growing. The open source community is already looking to make a contribution. [Chai Bio](https://www.chaibio.com/), the creators of the seminal [OpenPCR](https://openpcr.org/) and the far more advanced, but somewhat less accessible [Open qPCR](https://www.chaibio.com/openqpcr), is close to [releasing a kit](https://www.chaibio.com/coronavirus) to enable environmental detection of COVID-19. Shingo Hisakawa, who has many years of experience making open source PCR accessible to more users, [has his own project](https://github.com/hisashin/NinjaPCR/wiki/NinjaPCR's-fight-with-COVID-19?fbclid=IwAR3zVo0g4cXKCh9KKiO6XbMFc_4h3FdSmK-YXfgjyRqvdFrzBFUUviQ-EDc). And the bio hacker community is also jumping in. You can read more about their efforts on [Just One Giant Lab](https://app.jogl.io/project/118) (jogl).

I often say that the truly difficult global problems are almost never purely technical ones; they are issues of how we as people organize ourselves to solve problems – or fail to solve those problems. Medical supply chains are no different. They are about much more than just physical stuff, they are about the people who design, develop, deliver and then use those supplies. When this crisis passes, and we look at what has changed and needs to change as a result, we may recognize these hardware community projects as harbingers of future architectures that health systems will need to adopt in order to be responsive to tomorrow’s challenges.
