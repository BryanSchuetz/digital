Beginning in 2021, as people around the world—and their governments—were grappling with the rapid transition to digital technology, the DAI-implemented USAID [Digital Frontiers](https://www.digitalfrontiersdai.com/) project began working closely with the Technology Division of USAID’s Innovation, Technology, and Research (ITR) Hub to create a conceptual model of digital government (often called ‘e-government’). The model is now [live](https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/digital-government-model) and available to the public.

The goal of the model, at its core, is descriptive. Using existing literature as well as USAID’s own experience as a starting point, the model creates a clear conceptual understanding of the various elements of digital government and the risks of digitizing systems, processes, and tools at a rapid pace. ITR/T also consulted heavily with USAID’s Center for Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance (DRG Center) in developing this model. The diagram above summarizes the various elements of the model.
