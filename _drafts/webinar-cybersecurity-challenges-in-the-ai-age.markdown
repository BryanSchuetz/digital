Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to strengthen cybersecurity by detecting cyber threats more quickly and effectively. Imagine, for instance, if embedded malware meant to disrupt a hospital systems operation was detected within minutes of its installation, rather than after it disrupted access to electronic medical health records, delaying medical treatments? In such a scenario, the use of AI to detect a cyber-attack could literally mean life or death. Nevertheless, the use of AI also introduces its own set of cybersecurity vulnerabilities that bad actors can exploit. For example, it can amplify the exploitation of vulnerabilities across digital systems. The use of IoT (Internet of Things) coupled with AI will further densify the attack surface.

On November 3, 2021, I had the privilege to moderate a panel hosted by [DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/digital-acceleration) and the [World Bank's Global Forum on Law Justice and Development Working Group on Law and Technology](https://globalforumljd.com/) covering *Cybersecurity Challenges in the AI Age. *I highly recommend you take the time to listen to my conversation with Irakli Berizde (Head of the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute), Mark Williams (Practice Manager, Digital Development Global Practice, The World Bank), and Katerina Sedova (Research Fellow, Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology).

You can watch it or listen to it via the video below or at this [link](https://globalforumljd.com/events/2021/cybersecurity-challenges-ai-age).
