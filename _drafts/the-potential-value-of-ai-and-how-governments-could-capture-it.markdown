Artificial intelligence (AI) could have a significant impact on individuals, businesses, and governments. Here is what countries need to know about its benefits—and the first steps toward realizing them.

The long-term potential of AI to change key aspects of the way we live and to support the operations of businesses, governments, and other organizations is hard to grasp. 

Indeed, AI has contributed to improvements in quality of life for all segments of society through innovations such as [predictive healthcare](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/transforming-healthcare-with-ai), [adaptive education](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/education/our-insights/how-artificial-intelligence-will-impact-k-12-teachers), and [optimized crisis response](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/applying-artificial-intelligence-for-social-good). The National Health Service in the United Kingdom, for instance, set up a National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database containing a shared library of chest X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images to support the testing and development of AI technologies to treat COVID-19 and a variety of other health conditions. Businesses have seen increased productivity and operational efficiency using autonomous robotics in manufacturing, AI-optimized supply chains, and intelligent cargo routing with autonomous vehicles, among other initiatives. For example, many logistics companies are using AI-powered sorting robots to optimize their warehouse operations. Governments can also harness the power of AI through personalized services and automated processes. Consider Singapore’s “Ask Jamie,” a virtual assistant that helps citizens and businesses navigate government services across roughly 70 government agencies through AI-powered chat and voice.

But governments face numerous barriers—including a lack of specialized talent, limited investments in AI research and innovation, and often-unclear regulations designed to ensure that AI is applied in an ethical, secure, transparent, and human-centric manner across all sectors—that could prevent them from adopting AI use cases and capturing their value. Indeed, when developing and deploying AI use cases, it is critical that governments proactively consider and address the fast-changing universe of [privacy, security risks, and ethical pitfalls](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/getting-to-know-and-manage-your-biggest-ai-risks) that AI technologies can expose them to.

Below, we share three steps to measure the potential impact of AI in a country, and we examine how this could play out in a handful of countries. We also review a range of initiatives that could help governments overcome current challenges and capture this value throughout their economies. These initiatives include launching programs in the areas where AI could have the most impact for the country, creating a vibrant AI ecosystem, and appointing an AI authority, as some countries have already done.

## Measuring the Potential Impact of AI in a Country
AI may mean different things to different people, but here, we use the term “AI” to refer to a subset of data analytics. AI systems include computer vision, natural-language processing, and advanced robots. They are both autonomous (performing complex tasks without human supervision) and adaptive (improving by “learning” from more data).

In September 2018, the McKinsey Global Institute modeled trends in AI adoption, using early adopters and their performance as a leading indicator of how businesses across the board may want to absorb AI. In the aggregate and netting out competition effects and transition costs, early evidence suggests that AI could potentially deliver an additional global economic output of about $13 trillion by 2030, [boosting global gross domestic product](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/notes-from-the-ai-frontier-modeling-the-impact-of-ai-on-the-world-economy) (GDP) by about 1.2 percent a year.

However, while it’s generally understood that AI holds a great deal of potential, it can be difficult to measure and track the impact of AI in a specific country in a structured manner that can be replicated. Below is a methodology that could help governments estimate this potential (also see, “Considerations when quantifying the impact of AI”).

1. **Identify the most relevant use case domains.** Our research suggests that the hundreds of AI use cases that have the potential to unlock value in countries can be grouped into 15 domains, which can inform efforts to measure impact. While each of these use case domains includes numerous AI applications, the underlying technologies and mechanisms through which they create value are similar, as is their typical impact when applied across like organizations. It may be useful to determine which use case domains are the most relevant for businesses and organizations across sectors of the economy. For example, the most relevant domains for manufacturing are yield, energy, and throughput (where AI could enable predictive machinery maintenance and resource productivity maximization) and integrated supply chain optimization (including demand forecasting and inventory optimization).
2. **Scale up impact to the sector and economy level.** Suppose that for one manufacturing company, all relevant use case domains combined can increase EBIT by 10 percent. If total EBIT for all companies in the sector is $10 billion, then that EBIT would rise to $11 billion. If net operating surplus (approximated by EBIT) accounts for 50 percent of gross value add (GVA)—that is, contribution to GDP—in the manufacturing industry (which would total $20 billion), an industry-wide 10 percent EBIT increase from AI would increase the sector’s GVA by 5 percent. Once the impact at the sector level is understood, it can be scaled up to the total economy level by adding up the impact of all sectors.

Of course, governments must carefully consider and address the potential risks of implementing AI technology. These [risks](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/getting-to-know-and-manage-your-biggest-ai-risks) include the following:

* **Privacy.** Is the privacy of customers being protected through adherence to local and global data privacy regulations?
* **Security.** Is the AI model comprehensively protected against cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks?
* **Fairness.** Is the AI model fair and unbiased toward all segments of customers?
* **Transparency and explainability.** Is it possible to explain how the AI model works and the methodology it uses?
* **Safety and performance.** Has the AI model been adequately tested to ensure that the desired safety and performance are delivered each time?
* **Third-party risks.** Are all third-party vendors and partners following the required risk mitigation and governance standards?

## Methodology in Action: The Potential Impact of AI Across Gulf Cooperation Council Countries
Many countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)—Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)—are working to diversify their economies away from oil, modernize them, and increase efficiency through technology. AI is one of the technologies that many GCC countries are betting on. For example, in October 2017, the UAE government launched the [UAE Strategy for Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.gov.ae/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/UAE-National-Strategy-for-Artificial-Intelligence-2031.pdf), one of the first of its kind in the region. Similarly, in October 2020, the Saudi Data and AI Authority in Saudi Arabia launched its [National Strategy for Data and AI](https://www.carringtonmalin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NDAIS-Strategy-Narrative-V2-19Oct20.pdf) with the ambition of elevating the kingdom as a global leader in the elite league of data-driven economies.

When applied across all GCC countries, our methodology reveals a $150 billion potential value across all sectors of their combined economies. Our analysis shows that AI could potentially add value corresponding to 6 percent or more of each economic sector’s GDP in GCC countries.
