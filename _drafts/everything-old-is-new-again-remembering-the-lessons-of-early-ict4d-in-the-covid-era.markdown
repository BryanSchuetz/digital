Often in the early days of digital development (back then, still called ICT4D), it felt like there was a small group of big, innovative brains in one room all working on similar visions of how best to leverage the growing presence of the iconic Nokia 3310 across the developing world. Frontline SMS, Ushahidi, Souktel and others were leading the charge from various corners of the Earth, and design luminaries like Jan Chipchase were [interviewed](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/13/magazine/13anthropology-t.html) in *New York Times* think pieces on how cellphones could end global poverty.  When I moved to Palestine to work for Souktel in the end of 2010, I was often literally in the same room as ICT4D "godparents" Ken Banks, Adele Waugaman and Erik Hersman, pleading our case to skeptical mobile network operators and Silicon Valley types who found our little ventures thrilling in a slightly Orientalist way. With SMS as the tech du jour, everyone codified similar lessons in real time around the successful design of, for example, mobile awareness campaigns. The ICT4D sector grew rapidly across markets, simultaneously building strong use cases for users and development practitioners alike. I do have some hilarious stories of mobile campaign lessons learned from the Somali piracy crisis, but I will save those for another day.

Now, all these lessons are relevant again as we globally try to tackle COVID-19.

Despite the decade that has passed, and the almost unimaginable maturation and growth of both the global mobile sector and what we now call digital development, we once again dust off tried & true methods of engaging with users. Basic mobile solutions – from providing SMS and IVR gateways, using shortcodes, and developing outreach campaign strategies – are again becoming a compelling way to both connect at scale and fight the noise and misinformation passed around on social media platforms.

We have seen the success of this type of approach. In the peak of the South Korea COVID crisis, the government used a [hard-coded contact ](https://thediplomat.com/2020/03/lessons-from-south-koreas-covid-19-outbreak-the-good-bad-and-ugly/)in each phone to send almost hourly, real-time SMS updates across the country around both general COVID safety and user-specific contact tracing-based potential exposure alerts. This hard-coded contact meant there was no question about its authenticity, alleviating concerns about pranks and false reports. This SMS-based information, aligned with television, radio and internet campaigns, counteracted rumors and misinformation and was one of the driving reasons South Korea was able to mount such a [successful COVID response](https://www.ictworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/korea-flattening-covid-19-curve.pdf).

On the digital team at DAI, we've been working together to rapidly develop quick reference guides for our projects around the world who now find themselves leaning far more heavily on digital solutions than previously anticipated.  I've put a selection of our user engagement best practices below, which I hope will be a help to folks who find themselves staring at the user interface of an online SMS gateway system with great trepidation about where to begin.

* **Meet the users where they are.** Choose a digital solution that your target users already use and trust. Provide clear instructions to users about how to use the solution.

* **Sensitize users to upcoming campaigns.** User engagement is higher if beneficiaries/constituents expect a project to contact them on a digital device.

* **Create relevant local content.** Use the local language, and ensure that local sociocultural norms inform your messaging.


* **Keep it short and simple.** Clear, direct, and succinct messages work best on digital devices. If launching an SMS-based survey, use maximum five questions and ideally a reverse-charge shortcode so as not to burden your user with the response fees.

* **Use multiple outreach methods.**  If budgets allow, consider creating a multi-channel campaign with a consistent identity that employs different digital platforms to reach the target audience (like South Korea!)

* **Maintain user privacy.** Enact a clear set of guidelines governing data privacy and use.

* **Pilot and iterate.** Conduct small tests with target users and make any changes as needed. Apply any lessons learned from the pilots before scaling up.

* **There is no perfect solution.** Every option has drawbacks, but that should not stop us from trying.
