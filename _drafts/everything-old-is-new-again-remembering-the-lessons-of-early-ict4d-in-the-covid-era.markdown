Often in the early days of digital development (back then, still called ICT4D), it felt like there was a small group of big, innovative brains in one room all working on similar visions of how best to leverage the growing presence of the iconic Nokia 3310 across the developing world. Frontline SMS, Ushahidi, Souktel and others were leading the charge from various corners of the Earth, and design luminaries like Jan Chipchase were [interviewed](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/13/magazine/13anthropology-t.html) in New York Times think pieces on how cellphones could end global poverty.  When I moved to Palestine to work for Souktel in the end of 2010, I was often literally in the same room as ICT4D "godparents" Ken Banks, Adele Waugaman and Erik Hersman, pleading our case to skeptical mobile network operators and Silicon Valley types who found our little ventures thrilling in a slightly Orientalist way. As SMS was the tech du jour, everyone codified similar lessons around successful design of, for example, mobile awareness campaign best practices as we all  learned in real time as the sector grew rapidly across markets and developed strong use cases. I do have some hilarious stories of mobile campaign lessons learned from the Somali piracy crisis, but I will save those for another day. 

Now, all these lessons are relevant again as we globally try to tackle COVID. Despite the decade that has passed, and the almost unimaginable maturation and growth of both the global mobile sector and what we now call digital development, we once again dust off old SMS gateways and think through campaign strategies and shortcode provision as basic mobile solutions become a compelling way to both connect at scale and fight the noise and misinformation of social media platforms. 

In the peak of the South Korea COVID crisis, the government used a [hard-coded contact ](https://thediplomat.com/2020/03/lessons-from-south-koreas-covid-19-outbreak-the-good-bad-and-ugly/)in each phone to send almost hourly, real-time updates across the country around both general COVID safety and user-specific contact tracing-based potential exposure alerts. This hard-coded contact meant there was no question about its authenticity, alleviating concerns about pranks and false reports. This SMS-based information, aligned with television, radio and internet campaigns, counteracted rumors and misinformation and was one of the driving reasons South Korea was able to mount such a successful COVID response.
