We’re so excited to announce that [Kosmos Innovation Center Ghana](https://dai-global-digital.com/catalyzing-ghanas-growing-agritech-ecosystem.html) -- the Kosmos Energy-funded project that DAI helps implement – was [announced the winner](https://wirenews.org/press-release/kosmos-innovation-center-wins-2018-p3-impact-award/) of the 2018 P3 Impact Award at the annual Concordia Summit in New York. The award is presented each year by the US State Department, the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, and Concordia. In their [analysis ](https://ideas.darden.virginia.edu/2018/09/kosmos-innovation-center-a-p3-partnership/)of the KIC model, Darden School faculty members concluded that KIC has “begun to demonstrate the great potential of cross-sector partnerships to enable not only individual empowerment, but also fundamental societal transformation.” Congratulations also to our fellow 2018 finalists: DREAMS Partnership, Griha Pravesh, Lake Kivu Coffee Alliance, and MIP Futuro.
