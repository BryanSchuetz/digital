To the casual observer, Chamelecón looks like any other marginalized Central American neighborhood: low-slung, pastel-colored shops line its main road, channeling a ceaseless flow of pedestrians, produce carts, motorcycles and cars. Yet behind this mundane appearance, the residents of Chamalecón face some significant challenges: poverty, unemployment, migration, family disintegration, gang infiltration, violence and impunity. While this combination of risk factors is common in marginalized neighborhoods around Central America, in communities on the periphery of San Pedro Sula like Chamalecón, they coincide with acute force—each factor feeding off the rest and exacerbating the daily risks that residents face.

With those challenges in mind, DAI is hard at work developing a deeper understanding of the problems that people in Chamalecón and other marginalized neighborhoods around Honduras face, and considering what solutions may be best suited for the situation, including ICT-enabled ones.
During January of 2016, I spent two weeks in some of Honduras most marginalized neighborhoods, interviewing young people on: how they receive and share information, what kinds of communications technology they use, the mobile phones they choose, and the apps they use most, all with the goal of learning how best to communicate and engage with this particularly vulnerable segment. The survey included 213 young people between the ages of 15 and 33, who live in marginalized neighborhoods in three locations: Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula, and in rural communities around the western department of La Paz.

Over the last month we’ve been analyzing the data, and have come to some surprising conclusions about how young Hondurans receive and share information. This is the first in a series of blog posts that will explore the situation in Honduras and what DAI found via the Consumer Insights process. Today we’ll cover only the demographics of our sample along with a couple high-level insights.
