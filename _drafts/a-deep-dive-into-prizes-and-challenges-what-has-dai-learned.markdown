A few months ago, our colleagues at the [Digital Asia Accelerator](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USAID_Digital_Asia_Accelerator_Fact_Sheet.pdf) buy-in under the Digital Frontiers project asked [Alex Sekhniashvili](https://dai-global-digital.com/authors/alexander-sekhniashvili/) and me to identify and synthesize DAI’s lessons learned administering prizes and challenges across its USAID portfolio. Given DAI’s long history implementing the [Grand Challenges for Development Implementation Services](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-grand-challenges-development-implementation-services), [Center for Development Innovation (CDI) Professional Management Services,](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-center-development-innovation-professional-management-services) and [Digital Frontiers](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df) projects on behalf of USAID – there are quite a lot of learnings! So Alex and I dove deep into the world of prizes and challenges, reading project documents and interviewing a number of DAI staff. Because we at Digital@DAI are all about fostering a culture of transparency in the digital development space, we are pleased to share our findings with our readership as well.

## What are prizes and challenges anyway?

To paraphrase [USAID’s Tools for Innovation Programming. Step 4: Design and Implement Program](https://static.globalinnovationexchange.org/s3fs-public/asset/document/Innovation%20Toolkit%20STEP%204%20Design%20and%20Implement%20Strategy.pdf?kIx2UF_5yYkBp6N1._bNZqjjxR1.nli3) and [USAID’s Tools for Innovation Programming – Prizes Toolkit:](https://static.globalinnovationexchange.org/asset/document/PrizesToolkit2015_Final_0.pdf)

* **Prizes** are a pay-for-results mechanism that incentivizes competitors to achieve a specific outcome, while remaining agnostic about how to fulfill that outcome. Prize competitions pay for success by making one-time cash awards (and sometimes providing non-monetary support) to competition winners who achieve a specific outcome.

* **Challenges** (aka “grant competitions”) are a type of competition that awards grants and sometimes non-financial rewards to applicants with the best innovation or solution prior to the accomplishment of outcomes. A standard USAID grant typically results from the challenge process.

## Those two things sound similar, yet how do prizes and challenges actually differ?

From our research, Alex and I found three main differences:

* **Intent** – Prizes ask applicants to achieve one precise outcome; challenges ask applicants to respond to a broad set of challenges, resulting in a portfolio of creative approaches and solutions.

* **Levels of funder involvement and control** – Prizes give out one-time cash disbursements (with no further funder involvement), while challenges typically end in standard USAID grant agreements with ongoing reporting requirements.

* **Numbers of awards and dollar values** – Though not a hard and fast rule, challenges typically offer successful applicants more awards of smaller dollar value mixed with other incentives, and prizes typically award fewer awards of larger dollar value. (Challenges and prizes alike can also offer non-monetary incentives, like mentoring.)

## Prizes and challenges sound like a lot of work (Note: They are.) Why run a prize or a challenge?

Prizes and challenges are meant to raise awareness about a specific issue, usually by increasing engagement with non-traditional development partners . As a staged process with multiple rounds that seeks to bring new players into the fold, they require a lot of upfront investment and communications support.

## Enough with the background info -- what are the actual lessons learned?

On the technical side:

* **Consider recruiting private sector actors as full partners**. Strategic private sector partners can bring their brand name, resources, monetary contribution, established communications channels, publicity, mentors, and more to a prize or challenge. However, coordinating with private sector actors can significantly increase the management burden. Define their role and set expectations early.

* **Define your target audience and figure out how to reach them**. Because challenges and prizes are geared toward raising awareness about specific issues, the communications piece is critical and capital intensive. Deciding on your target audience for applications and figuring out how best to reach them will help increase the prize/challenge’s visibility – social media, referrals, industry pages, webinars, and media interviews can all work well.

* **Craft specific calls to action with minimal jargon.** Highly specific and inspirational calls often lead to more creative solutions. Even global challenges addressing a worldwide problem can call for applicants to present localized solutions for an organization’s own defined target audience. Organizers can request anything from short concept notes to full applications in the first phase. Requesting short concept notes, for instance, may lead to more applicants. The dollar amount of potential awards and the required level of paperwork influences the number and types of organizations that apply.

* **In addition to funding, provide non-monetary incentives**. Applicants appreciate and benefit from non-monetary incentives, such as technical assistance, coaching, mentorship, and even meeting other applicants. During the prize/challenge process, work closely with innovators to define incentives that will add the most value to their organizations.

* **Invest in experts to serve as judges, mentors, and advisors.** Outside experts with deep knowledge of the relevant technical area can help design prizes and challenges that get to the heart of the problem. They can also provide invaluable feedback and can support winners to implementing highly successful solutions.

On the operational/administrative side:

* **Prizes and challenges require heavy staff level of effort (LOE).** Because they consist of multiple stages and are intended to generate heavy publicity, prizes and challenges require a lot of staff time to manage the process -- particularly if they receive a lot of initial applications that require someone to read through and evaluate all applications.

* **Consider bringing on subcontractors to manage some of the workload.** Subcontractors with deep experience in managing prizes/challenges, ideally with deep local knowledge, can relieve the burden on project staff. It may also make sense to bring on a subcontractor who can handle a narrower piece of work, such as local communications and PR.

* **Use an application intake platform (an application website).** Do not rely on email submissions, especially if you’re reviewing hundreds of applications. Off-the-shelf solutions offer the most bang for your buck.

* **Prizes and challenges are expensive, so plan accordingly.** The cost of high staff LOE, subcontractors, and application intake platforms (in addition to possible in-person co-creation sessions) can add up, so plan accordingly to ensure a prize or challenge can fit in your budget.

Planning and executing prize and challenge competitions is hard work. Though not comprehensive by any means, we hope that the tips and lessons learned above will make it a smoother process for all implementers in the future!
