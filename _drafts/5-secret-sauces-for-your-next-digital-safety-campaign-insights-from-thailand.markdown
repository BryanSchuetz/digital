In the previous blog on [Five Fresh Tips to Make Digital Safety Cool Again: A Case Study from Thailand](https://dai-global-digital.com/five-fresh-tips-to-make-digital-safety-cool-again-a-case-study-from-thailand.html), we discussed lessons learned from implementing the [‘Wai Kid Digital’](https://th.usembassy.gov/united-states-celebrates-young-leaders-of-digital-literacy-in-thailand/) Challenge (‘the Challenge’), a series of virtual training bootcamps with university students on digital safety and creative video production. Looking back two months after the activity wrapped up, here are our top 5 secret sauces for your next digital safety campaign:

1. Build private sector partnerships that create shared value;

2. Use hybrid approaches to engage Gen Z;

3. Embed experience-based learning and networking opportunities;

4. Localize your content to pave way for sustainability;

5. Make MEL capture the real story.

The Digital Asia Accelerator, part of the U.S. Government’s [Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership](https://www.state.gov/digital-connectivity-and-cybersecurity-partnership/), partnered with Facebook Thailand and Love Frankie (a local social change agency) to design and launch the Challenge. We then collaborated with nearly 400 university students around the country to demystify digital safety and educate the public about digital safety and identity, positive online communication, news literacy, and critical thinking through creative videos.

# 1. Build private sector partnerships that create shared value

The first secret sauce to spice up your next digital safety campaign is to build private sector partnerships that create shared value. How might that look in practical terms?

The Accelerator's and Facebook's shared goal was to equip young people with digital skills to help the Thai public thrive in online spaces – creatively, securely, and ethically. Creating shared value would require us to work together to achieve that goal. Within that shared goal, the Accelerator's specific objective was to raise people's awareness of how to stay safe online, while Facebook Thailand's was building positive online communities and helping young people share their voices creatively.

From a resource standpoint, we both brought key assets to the table. The Accelerator and USAID brought financial support, program management, and development expertise, resulting in a digitally inclusive strategy, customized training curriculum, and strong program execution. From Facebook's side, their brand value and ad credits enabled the campaign to reach and capture the attention of a much larger audience vs. what we would have been able to reach on our own. While USAID has improved lives around the world over the past 60 years, it isn't a common household brand for some communities in Thailand. [Thais on average spent over 11 hours on the internet per day in 2020, and 98% of Thais use Facebook.](https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2099991/time-spent-on-internet-surges-in-2020) The partnership with Facebook Thailand thus gave the program high visibility and vibrancy right from the start. During the training bootcamp, experts from USAID and Facebook worked together to provide first-hand expertise and experience on digital inclusion and video content creation to the students. This direct engagement was one of the most popular elements of training for the participants.

**What this means for your program:** At the beginning of program design, align on both partners' vision, goals, and capabilities. Even if a partnership is not 100% perfect, it is still valuable and worth pursuing if it leverages each other's capabilities towards achieving your objectives under a common goal.

# 2. Use hybrid approaches to engage Gen Z

Many of us experienced loneliness and Zoom fatigue during lockdowns throughout COVID-19 outbreaks. Our Wai Kid Digital Challenge was no different. Having to shift from the design of in-person boot camps with students meant we lost some human connection (e.g., physically high fiving!). However, this Challenge also provided us with a new set of opportunities.

Some students reported that they appreciated the program being entirely virtual because it provided them with more flexibility to review the materials and discussions afterward without sacrificing their university time. One student mentioned how he particularly enjoyed the chance to interact with students from other universities during the bootcamp sessions, which would not have happened in the original plan for separate in-person events at each university. The same student recommended that if we have another iteration of the Wai Kid Digital Challenge, he would love to see a hybrid approach in which there are opportunities to learn from content online and interact with other participants in person. Such opportunities might be in the form of early joint meetings with all participating universities or in a post-Summit gathering to celebrate their virtual bootcamp journeys. The participant told us it would have allowed him to share his thoughts and experiences on digital safety more organically with other students, without bandwidth or hardware challenges.

**What this means for your program:** Virtual engagements do not automatically mean less interaction! When planned well, these programs can even offer benefits beyond in-person events, particularly when it comes to accessing learning materials. When possible, consider how to include in-person interaction between participants and design hybrid approaches.

# 3. Embed experience-based learning and networking opportunities

Many students expressed that they were looking forward to learning from industry experts (e.g., Facebook and Thai influencers) throughout the program – and wanted even more access to industry after the program ended.

Over 78% of program participants reported that getting the chance to pitch their ideas to USAID, Facebook, and Thai influencers was the most impactful part. This program gave young people an opportunity to learn real-world skills beyond their usual experiences in the classroom. One student told us that, *"I think \[the bootcamps are\] already good but it'd be great to have more time to hear influencers speak about their experiences. Perhaps a Q&A session where we can ask questions."*

Another student reported learning more about diverse gender perspectives from a USAID staff member that better informed their video concept.

University instructors also appreciated the experience-based learning opportunities for students, sharing that *"Students got to work with the private sector, got close to people who work for social media platforms, and experts in the field. Their work will be commented \[on\] by experienced people. The students really enjoyed this. And they got to learn from experiences, rather than solely from academics."*

A student from the Challenge's winning team reported that getting the chance to learn about digital safety and content production from professional content creators at Facebook and USAID gave him the skills, credibility, and confidence to apply for his internship. Networking and gaining access to professional experiences in Thailand is already hard for many Thai students in "normal times," but it is even more challenging during COVID-19. He also shared that he may not have gotten this internship without his Wai Kid Digital experience!
