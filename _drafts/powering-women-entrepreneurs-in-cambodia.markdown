Meet Lida.

She might look like a typical 20-something Cambodian, but she’s anything but. Lida is the co-founder of [SHE Investments](https://www.sheinvestments.com/), a social enterprise that helps Cambodian women turn their entrepreneurship skills up to 11 (yes, out of 10).

##The Challenge
Why do women entrepreneurs in Cambodia need Lida and SHE Investments? Women run about 65% of all Cambodian businesses, but only about 2% of formal businesses. This lack of formal ownership makes it harder to claim profits, hire employees, access scale-up, and harder to protect intellectual property. To solve these problems and secure women’s stake in their own businesses, SHE runs incubation and acceleration services, mentorship programs, leadership and management training, conferences and events, and financing for women entrepreneurs and their businesses. And they’re good at it. Really good. SHE’s programs have resulted in some impressive gains for the women they support: 

-155%: the average increase in monthly business revenue for a SHE graduate
-130% the average decrease in debt across all SHE graduate businesses
-70%: the average increase in household savings for a SHE graduate

##Easy Easy

One of SHE’s newest and most popular services is [Ngeay Ngeay](http://ngeayngeay.co/), which means “easy easy” in Khmer, the local language. Ngeay Ngeay is a free web portal that helps informal businesses run by women get registered. The [USAID Development Innovations](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/cambodia-development-innovations) (DI) project, implemented by DAI, supported the initial development of Ngeay Ngeay with an innovation grant in 2017, and the site launched in August of the same year. Since then, the site has seen more than 60,000 page views and 13,000 unique visitors, and a deluge of direct requests from women entrepreneurs for deeper assistance with registration. 

As a result of the portal’s popularity, SHE is preparing scale-up the platform to include an e-learning component and full-service registration consulting, two additions that respond to direct user feedback and will promote the long-term sustainability of the service. DI will support the development of these new service lines via its 2018 innovation grant program, the ICT Project Scale Up Grant Fund, which was open to Cambodian CSOs and businesses. Winners had an active ICT for good pilot project, some measure of success to date, directed effort at user research and feedback, and a scale-up plan that clearly dovetails with the results of that user research. 

##Beyond SHE

Beyond the SHE Investments and the Ngeay Ngeay portal, Development Innovations is running other women’s economic empowerment programs in Cambodia. One of the most successful has been the [Technovation Challenge](https://technovationchallenge.org/), which was launched by Google in 2009 and helps girls, aged 10-18, learn business and leadership skills as well as basic coding. DI launched Technovation in Cambodia in 2014, and since then, has trained more than 400 girls to solve problems in their communities through a 12 week curriculum and national pitch competition.

In 2017, a group of Cambodian girls —all 11 and 12-years-old—was chosen as a finalist from a pool of more than 1000 teams around the world, and traveled to Silicon Valley to pitch their concept, [Cambodia Identity Product](http://geeksincambodia.com/cambodia-identity-product-the-cambodian-team-that-made-it-to-the-technovation-world-pitch-in-silicon-valley/).
