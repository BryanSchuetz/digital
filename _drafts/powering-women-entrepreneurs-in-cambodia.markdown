Meet Lida Loem.

She might look like a typical 20-something Cambodian; however, she’s anything but. Lida is the co-founder of [SHE Investments](https://www.sheinvestments.com/), a social enterprise that helps Cambodian women turn their entrepreneurship skills up to 11 (yes, out of 10).

## The Challenge
Why do women entrepreneurs in Cambodia need Lida and SHE Investments? Women run about 65% of all Cambodian businesses, but only about 2% of formal businesses. This lack of formal ownership makes it harder to claim profits, hire employees, access scale-up, and harder to protect intellectual property. To solve these problems and secure women’s stake in their own businesses, SHE runs incubation and acceleration services, mentorship programs, leadership and management training, conferences and events, and financing for women entrepreneurs and their businesses. And they’re good at it. Really good. SHE’s programs have resulted in some impressive gains for the women they support:

## Easy Easy

One of SHE’s most popular services is [Ngeay Ngeay](http://ngeayngeay.co/), which means “easy easy” in Khmer, the language spoken by most Cambodians. Ngeay Ngeay is a free web portal that helps informal businesses run by women get registered. The [USAID Development Innovations](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/cambodia-development-innovations) (DI) project, implemented by DAI, supported the creation of Ngeay Ngeay with an innovation grant in 2017, and the site launched in August of the same year. Since then, the site has seen more than 60,000 page views and 13,000 unique visitors, and a deluge of direct requests from women entrepreneurs for deeper assistance with registration.

As a result of the portal’s popularity, SHE is preparing scale-up the platform to include an e-learning component and full-service registration consulting, two additions that respond to direct user feedback and which will improve the long-term sustainability of the service. The DI project will support the development of these new service lines via its 2018 innovation grant program, the ICT Project Scale-Up Grant Fund, which was open to Cambodian CSOs and businesses and prioritized projects that had already shown some level of success, had conducted user testing, and proposed a scale-up plan based on the feedback from their users. 

## Beyond SHE

Beyond the SHE Investments and the Ngeay Ngeay portal, Development Innovations is also running one of Cambodia's most successful women’s economic empowerment programs in Cambodia: the [Technovation Challenge](https://technovationchallenge.org/). Technovation was launched by Google in 2009 to helps girls around the world, aged 10-18, learn business and leadership skills and equip them with basic coding skills. The competition is run annually around the globe, and was launched in Cambodia by the DI project team in 2014. Since then, Technovation Cambodia has trained more than 400 girls to solve problems in their communities through a 12 week curriculum and national pitch competition. 

In 2017, a group of Cambodian girls —all 11 and 12-years-old—was chosen as a finalist from a pool of more than 1000 teams around the world, and traveled to Silicon Valley to pitch their concept, [Cambodia Identity Product](http://geeksincambodia.com/cambodia-identity-product-the-cambodian-team-that-made-it-to-the-technovation-world-pitch-in-silicon-valley/).

The Development Innovations project runs through August 2019 and continues to empower women like Lida, her clients, and the Cambodia Identity Product team to build businesses and tech tools to solve problems in their communities.
