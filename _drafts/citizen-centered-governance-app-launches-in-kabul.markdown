In recent years, Kabul residents have complained of hours-long queues to access services at Kabul Municipality, and even further delays for follow-up after their requests were heard. Several weeks ago, Kabul Municipality’s solution was hard to ignore: news of their new citizen engagement mobile app could be seen displayed on 21 billboards throughout the city, broadcast on local television and online news sources, shared on social media, and showcased by Kabul Mayor Ahmad Zaki Sarfaraz at a launch event in Kabul among a gathering of 250 attendees and media outlets.

This launch is the culmination of a 16-month multi-phased process by DAI’s USAID-funded  Strong Hubs for Afghan Hope and Resilience (SHAHAR) project to improve communication and engagement between local government and their citizens, civil society, and businesses in Kabul Municipality. With technical guidance from DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration (CDA) – including yours truly, Addie Ryan and Trevor Olexy, and former CDA-er Adam Fivenson – SHAHAR worked alongside Kabul Municipality counterparts in a consultative, iterative process to transform this initiative from vision to reality. To ensure the app's functionality aligned with the interests of local stakeholders, we guided SHAHAR through a human-centered design (HCD) approach, working closely with the mayor, municipal departments, Wakeel-e-Guzars, interested civil society, and citizens to deliver an application based on users’ needs and expectations.

Bringing Citizens to the Design Table
In the initial discovery phase, we mapped and met with relevant stakeholders, identifying the objectives, data, systems, and commitment of the municipal staff. By applying Frontier Insights, DAI’s user discovery and research method, we explored the local digital ecosystem and learned how citizens in Kabul engage with technology. The data collected from these citizen surveys informed a design thinking session with key stakeholders to workshop the app concept, design, and functionality of the app. If you haven’t seen it, we wrote about our Frontier Insights results in Kabul in greater detail during the design phase.
