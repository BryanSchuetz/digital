In recent years, Kabul residents have complained of hours-long queues to access services at their municipal office, and even further delays for follow-up after their requests were heard. Several weeks ago, Kabul Municipality’s solution was hard to ignore: news of their new citizen engagement app could be seen displayed on 21 billboards throughout the city, broadcast on [local television](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqLA8GD-33I&feature=youtu.be) and [online news](http://www.outlookafghanistan.net/national_detail.php?post_id=25808) sources, shared on [social media](https://www.facebook.com/KabulMunicipality/posts/2194828510813555), and proudly showcased by Kabul Mayor Ahmad Zaki Sarfaraz at a launch event among a gathering of 250 attendees and media outlets.

This launch is the culmination of a 16-month, multi-phased process by DAI’s USAID-funded [Strong Hubs for Afghan Hope and Resilience (SHAHAR)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/afghanistan-strong-hubs-afghan-hope-and-resilience-shahar) project to improve communication and engagement between local governments and their citizens, civil society, and businesses in Afghanistan. With technical guidance from DAI’s [Center for Digital Acceleration](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/digital-acceleration) (CDA) – including yours truly, Addie Ryan and Trevor Olexy, and former CDA-er Adam Fivenson – SHAHAR worked alongside Kabul Municipality counterparts in a consultative, iterative process to transform this initiative from vision to reality.

**Bringing Citizens to the Design Table**

To ensure the app's functionality aligned with the interests of local stakeholders, we guided SHAHAR through a human-centered design (HCD) approach, working closely with the mayor, municipal departments, *Wakeel-e-Guzars*, interested civil society, and citizens to deliver an application based on users’ needs and expectations. In the initial discovery phase, we mapped and then met with relevant stakeholders, identifying the objectives, data, systems, and commitment of the municipal staff. By applying [Frontier Insights](https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=digital-insights), DAI’s user discovery and research method, we explored the local digital ecosystem and learned how citizens in Kabul engage with technology. The data collected from these citizen surveys informed a design thinking session that convened key stakeholders to workshop the app concept, design, and functionality of the app. If you haven’t seen it, we wrote about our [Frontier Insights results in Kabul](https://dai-global-digital.com/citizen-centered-design-and-frontier-insights-in-kabul-municipality.html) in greater detail during the design phase.

**App Launch**

Following a robust promotional campaign – including a 2D animation video broadcast on popular national TV stations in [Pashto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DpghQ8rXB4&feature=youtu.be) and [Dari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4n4kdJNBwM&feature=youtu.be) – and a well-attended launch event, the app quickly saw over 1,000 downloads. SHAHAR is already engaged in customized expansion of the app into four regional municipal hubs – Kandahar, Hirat, Jalalabad, and Mazar-e-Sharif – and government counterparts have expressed interest in presenting the app to President Ashraf Ghani, as well as expanding it into other provinces.
