In recent years, Kabul residents have complained of hours-long queues to access services at their municipal office, and even further delays for follow-up after their requests were heard. Several weeks ago, Kabul Municipality’s solution was hard to ignore: news of their new citizen engagement app could be seen displayed on 21 billboards throughout the city, broadcast on [local television](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqLA8GD-33I&feature=youtu.be) and [online news](http://www.outlookafghanistan.net/national_detail.php?post_id=25808) sources, shared on [social media](https://www.facebook.com/KabulMunicipality/posts/2194828510813555), and proudly showcased by Kabul Mayor Ahmad Zaki Sarfaraz at a launch event among a gathering of 250 attendees and media outlets.

This launch is the culmination of a 16-month, multi-phased process by DAI’s USAID-funded [Strong Hubs for Afghan Hope and Resilience (SHAHAR)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/afghanistan-strong-hubs-afghan-hope-and-resilience-shahar) project to improve communication and engagement between local governments and their citizens, civil society, and businesses in Afghanistan. With technical guidance from DAI’s [Center for Digital Acceleration](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/digital-acceleration) (CDA) – including yours truly, Addie Ryan and Trevor Olexy, and former CDA-er Adam Fivenson – SHAHAR worked alongside Kabul Municipality counterparts in a consultative, iterative process to transform this initiative from vision to reality.

**Bringing Citizens to the Design Table**

To ensure the app's functionality aligned with the interests of local stakeholders, we guided SHAHAR through a human-centered design (HCD) approach, working closely with the mayor, municipal departments, *Wakeel-e-Guzars*, interested civil society, and citizens to deliver an application based on users’ needs and expectations. In the initial discovery phase, we mapped and then met with relevant stakeholders, identifying the objectives, data, systems, and commitment of the municipal staff. By applying [Frontier Insights](https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=digital-insights), DAI’s user discovery and research method, we explored the local digital ecosystem and learned how citizens in Kabul engage with technology. The data collected from these citizen surveys informed a design thinking session that convened key stakeholders to workshop the app concept, design, and functionalities. If you haven’t seen it, we wrote about our [Frontier Insights results in Kabul](https://dai-global-digital.com/citizen-centered-design-and-frontier-insights-in-kabul-municipality.html) in greater detail during the design phase.

The design process led us to four primary app functionalities:

1. \*\*Municipal Plans and Information: \*\*Kabul citizens can access detailed information about development plans, public services, municipal laws and regulations, tourist sites, and phone numbers for emergency services and key municipal personnel.

2. \*\*Complaint Registration: \*\*Kabul citizens no longer need to wait for “office hours” to register a complaint with the municipality. They can file and track a complaint anytime and anywhere with their smart phone and municipal staff will take action to address their concern.

3. ***Safayi***\*\* Fee Calculator: \*\*Kabul citizens can calculate their annual *Safayi* (property tax) fees directly through the Kabul Municipality’s mobile app and will no longer need to physically travel to their municipal office to do so.

4. **Municipality News:** Kabul citizens can follow news and discussions related to the municipality’s activities including easy access to the municipality’s Facebook page and website.

**Building the App for the Citizens**

Once the design phase was complete, SHAHAR hired a local software development firm to build the application. While CDA provided technical feedback and guidance, SHAHAR’s all-star local *ICT Municipal App Project Manager*, Hafizullah Shinwari, played the pivotal role of day-to-day coordination and communication with both the developers and Kabul Municipality counterparts. Hafizullah’s role was critical in the success of this project. He kept things moving amid bureaucratic delays, administration changeover, mission creep, and last-minute requests for changes to the app. After several iterations, SHAHAR conducted user testing with 25 citizens – including government officials, *Wakeel-e-Guzars*, civil society representatives and SHAHAR staff – and subsequently incorporated a second color theme and additional icons on the landing page to provide quicker access to important sub menus within the app.

**App Launch**

Following a robust promotional campaign that included a 2D animation video broadcast on popular national TV stations in [Pashto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DpghQ8rXB4&feature=youtu.be) and [Dari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4n4kdJNBwM&feature=youtu.be) and a successful launch event, the app quickly saw over 1,000 downloads. While SHAHAR is already engaged in customized expansion of the app into four regional municipal hubs (Kandahar, Hirat, Jalalabad, and Mazar-e-Sharif), government counterparts have already expressed interest in further expansion and even presenting the app to President Ashraf Ghani.
