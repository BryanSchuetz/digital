In recent years, Kabul residents have complained of hours-long queues to access services at Kabul Municipality, and even further delays for follow-up after their requests were heard. Several weeks ago, Kabul Municipalityâ€™s solution was hard to ignore: news of their new citizen engagement mobile app could be seen displayed on 21 billboards throughout the city, broadcast on local television and online news sources, shared on social media, and showcased by Kabul Mayor Ahmad Zaki Sarfaraz at a launch event in Kabul among a gathering of 250 attendees and media outlets.
