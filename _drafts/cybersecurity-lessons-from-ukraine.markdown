## Cybersecurity Lessons from Ukraine

When you walk into a room of government officials, civil society organizations, and private companies discussing cybersecurity same topic, you expect to hear resounding disagreement. The exact opposite happened during the DAI- [SocialBoost](http://socialboost.com.ua/) Cybersecurity Roundtable and Workshop in Kyiv, Ukraine on June 25.

The event started with a panel discussion, with representatives from a myriad of key government institutions working to address Ukraine’s [cybersecurity challenges](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-cyber-war-frontline-russia-malware-attacks/). They included representatives from the Ministry of Energy, the Pension Fund of Ukraine, State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine, the Presidential Administration, Ministry of Infrastructure, and National Information Systems. Joining them were representatives from the company Information Systems Security Partners ([ISSP](https://www.issp.com/)) and law firm Sayenko Kharenko.

The panels focused primarily on two major topics: the general state of cybersecurity in Ukraine and the challenges cybersecurity poses to critical infrastructure sectors.

Protecting critical infrastructure from cyber-attack is a topic of focus in Ukraine and around the world. But what is critical infrastructure? According to the [U.K. Government](https://www.cpni.gov.uk/critical-national-infrastructure-0) critical infrastructure is the “facilities, systems, sites, information, people, networks and processes, necessary for a country to function and upon which daily life depends.” These include sectors like:

* Emergency Services

* Energy

* Government

* Health

* Finance

* Food

* Transportation

* Water

Running, maintaining, and staffing each of these sectors are ***people***, who are at the heart of efforts to improve cybersecurity. During the panels, , which is exactly what the panelists focused on. both the government officials and private sector representatives agreed that the most critical need to strengthening Ukraine’s cyber resilience is strengthening the population’s digital [skills](https://dai-global-digital.com/the-missing-digital-principle-educate-the-user.html). By making more people aware of cyber threats and teaching them how to mitigate these threats, the hope is that fewer successful cyber-attacks will take place.

## Teaching Cyber Hygiene

Following the panel, we (DAI and SocialBoost) led a cyber hygiene workshop for civil servants and entrepreneurs. The goal was to support bridging the human capital gap identified by the panelists earlier that day.

We started with the basics: practices that most people already know, but rarely employ. For example, the importance of using strong passwords, changing passwords, and employing different passwords. Starting with this is critical because [passwords](https://www.cisecurity.org/newsletter/why-strong-unique-passwords-matter/) are foundational to accessing nearly all digital tools and services. They also serve as one of the weakest points in a network, particularly if people are using weak or unchanged passwords to access the network’s services.

Though widely known, it was no surprise that few people or companies [employ](https://33kpvz33obwvvdeaa3co3hu1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/07/cybersecurity-ventures-thycoti_70778.pdf) good password management. The workshop participants were no different. They all had personal experience with their data getting stolen or misused, even though they knew that password management was essential to protecting their information. Of the participants who did employ good password management, it was only because they were prompted to by their employer.

In addition to the importance of passwords, we also addressed other important cyber hygiene skills that that are important to understand. For instance, the pros and cons of using VPNs, how to identify fake download buttons, and what considerations to take into account if designing a data collection tool. In Ukraine, understanding the pros and cons of using VPNs is particularly important. Following former President Proshenko’s decision to [ban](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/16/ukraine-blocks-popular-russian-websites-kremlin-role-war) the country’s most popular email service and social media networks, as part of sanctioning Russia for their annexation of Crimea, many Ukrainian’s started employing VPNs to visit these Russian owned sites. What many overlooked though was who owned these VPNs, meaning that they didn’t know who might be collecting or monitoring their data.

## Key Takeaways and Opportunities

Throughout all the activities and discussions two things became clear:

1. The panelists were right. People are the back bone of a country. If they are not empowered or offered the right resources to learn and employ cyber hygiene best practices, Ukraine’s cyber resilience will be limited.

2. Strengthening people’s skills is only half of the equation. To change behavior, cyber hygiene processes need to be integrated into the day-to-day tasks of a person’s life. In a professional setting, this will require support from the highest levels.

As demonstrated by the panelists and the workshop participants, there is an appetite for change. Change that empowers the Ukrainian people to employ cyber hygiene best practices to protect their personal data, but also critical government systems. The challenge, for Ukraine, will be allocating the right resources and coordinating the right partners to move this agenda forward. Keeping a keen eye on how the cyber landscape evolves will also be important and ensure that as foundational cyber hygiene skills are strengthened, new skills are also being acquired to consistently keep the ecosystem more secure. As one of the panelists surmised, accepting that “cybersecurity is a process, not a product,” is the first step in the right direction.
