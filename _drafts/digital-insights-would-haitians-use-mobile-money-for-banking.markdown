In late September, I traveled to Haiti to conduct research on how Haitians engage with financial institutions and mobile technology to explore the feasibility of introducing mobile money as an avenue for the provision of financial services. Together with the team from the [USAID/Haiti Finance Inclusive project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/haiti-finance-inclusive-fininc), implemented by DAI, and with support from our sister USAID/Haiti project Finance Pour Tous and two key credit unions – [Caisse Populaire Fraternite (CPF)](https://www.facebook.com/CPFRATERNITE/) and Socolavim – I traveled to nine locations through the North and Central departments of the country to interview 181 credit union customers as they went about their business at credit union branches.

`The DAI team interviewed 181 Haitian credit union customers in 9 different locations, meeting people were they were going about their business utilizing credit union services.`

The process mirrored our [Digital Insights](https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=digital-insights) work in other countries, but focused specifically on exploring how mobile technology might play a role in overcoming some of the constraints that credit union customers are facing in accessing financial services. The goal was to determine whether mobile technology could be a viable instrument for financial service providers to better serve lower tier markets. To that end, we targeted credit union customers across multiple locations in Haiti to find out how they interact with financial institutions and mobile technology, and what their attitudes towards potential mobile banking products might be.

## The numbers:

## The Findings:

1. People still rely largely on traditional media sources for their news (radio and television), but are active mobile phone users. 98% of interviewees owned a mobile phone, and 72% of owned smartphones – a surprisingly high number. Haitian credit union customers also proved to be prolific messengers, sending an average of just under 80 messages using various platforms on their mobile phones per day, with Facebook and WhatsApp dominating the landscape of smartphone apps used for communication purposes.

2. People have a high level of confidence in credit unions as trustworthy financial institutions and are happy with the services they offer, but are often frustrated with the perceived inefficiencies of some of those services. This offers a significant opportunity for services like mobile money to save them time: the services that people regularly visit their credit union branches for are overwhelmingly simple transactions that could be automated with mobile technology to eliminate the need to travel to credit union branches and wait in long lines.

3. People have a basic awareness of mobile money products available on the market and generally have a positive attitude towards the concept of mobile money as a service. However, their understanding of how mobile money works and how to use it is limited, and a general lack of trust of network operators hinders people from opening mobile money accounts. At first pass, it seemed that a significant number of people felt as though they didn’t see the value in having their own mobile money account, yet when we dug into this specific issue, more often than not it turned out that people didn’t really understand what they could do with their own account. Some people even left after our interview only to come back minutes later saying they had given it some though and they would like us to help them open an account!

Furthermore, the value of mobile money for executing remote transactions is undeniable, as we observed that among many of those who don’t have their own mobile money account, people simply used third parties as a workaround to transfer money using mobile wallets.\

It turns out that among the 68 percent of credit union customers that do not have their own mobile money account, the leading barriers to adoption are a lack of understanding of the products on the market, and a significant level of mistrust of mobile network operators.

1. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, across the spectrum of potential mobile money applications in people’s daily lives, Haitian credit union customers are very open to the possibility of using mobile money, with the vast majority of those interviewed expressing openness to using their mobile phones for a variety of financial transaction applications.

Overall, we learned that there are three main drivers preventing Haitian credit union customers from making use of mobile money services: (1) lack of understanding of mobile money products, (2) little clarity about the the services mobile money products offer, and (3) incomprehension of how mobile money functions. However, attitudes towards such platforms were generally very positive and people were explicitly open to and often even excited about the prospect of using mobile money for financial transactions to avoid some of the inefficiencies and security concerns of banking in person. These findings point to a conclusion that mobile money as a vehicle for credit union service offerings holds significant potential, but would likely only work with a fundamental digital literacy push among credit union customers to ensure that the platforms are used correctly and customers do not become disenchanted.
