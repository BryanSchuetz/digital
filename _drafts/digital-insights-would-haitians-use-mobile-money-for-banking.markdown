In late September, I traveled to Haiti to develop a picture of how some Haitians engage with financial institutions and mobile technology to explore the feasibility of introducing mobile money as an avenue for the provision of financial services. Together with the team from the [USAID/Haiti Finance Inclusive project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/haiti-finance-inclusive-fininc), implemented by DAI, and with support from our sister USAID/Haiti project Finance Pour Tous and two key credit unions – [Caisse Populaire Fraternite (CPF)](https://www.facebook.com/CPFRATERNITE/) and Socolavim – I traveled to 9 locations through the North and Central departments of the country to interview 181 credit union customers as they went about their business at credit union branches.

\`The DAI team interviewed 181 Haitian credit union customers in 9 different locations, meeting people were they were going about their business utilizing credit union services.\`

The process mirrored our [Digital Insights](https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=digital-insights) work in other countries, but focused specifically on exploring how mobile technology might play a role in overcoming some of the constraints that credit union customers are facing in accessing financial services. The goal was to determine whether mobile technology could be a viable instrument for financial service providers to better serve lower tier markets. To that end, we targeted credit union customers across multiple locations in Haiti to find out how they interact with financial institutions and mobile technology, and what their attitudes towards potential mobile banking products might be.
