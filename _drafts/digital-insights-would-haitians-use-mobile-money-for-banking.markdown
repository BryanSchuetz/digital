In late September, I traveled to Haiti to develop a picture of how some Haitians engage with financial institutions and mobile technology to explore the feasibility of introducing mobile money as an avenue for the provision of financial services. Together with the team from the [USAID/Haiti Finance Inclusive project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/haiti-finance-inclusive-fininc), implemented by DAI, and with support from our sister USAID/Haiti project Finance Pour Tous and two key credit unions – [Caisse Populaire Fraternite (CPF)](https://www.facebook.com/CPFRATERNITE/) and Socolavim – I traveled to 9 locations through the North and Central departments of the country to interview 181 credit union customers as they went about their business at credit union branches.

\`The DAI team interviewed 181 Haitian credit union customers in 9 different locations, meeting people were they were going about their business utilizing credit union services.\`

The process mirrored our [Digital Insights](https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=digital-insights) work in other countries, but focused specifically on exploring how mobile technology might play a role in overcoming some of the constraints that credit union customers are facing in accessing financial services. The goal was to determine whether mobile technology could be a viable instrument for financial service providers to better serve lower tier markets. To that end, we targeted credit union customers across multiple locations in Haiti to find out how they interact with financial institutions and mobile technology, and what their attitudes towards potential mobile banking products might be.

## The Findings:

1. People still rely largely on traditional media sources for their news (Radio and Television), but are active mobile phone users. 98% of all people owning a mobile phone, and 72% of them owning smartphones – a somewhat surprisingly high number. Haitian credit union customers also proved to be prolific messengers, sending an average of just under 80 messages using various platforms on their mobile phones per day, with Facebook and WhatsApp dominating the landscape of smartphone apps used for communication purposes.\

2. People have a high level of confidence in credit unions as trustworthy financial institutions and are happy with the services they offer, but are often frustrated with the perceived inefficiencies of some of those services. The services that people regularly visit their credit union branches for are overwhelmingly simple transactions that could be automated with mobile technology to eliminate the need to travel to credit union branches and wait in long lines. \
