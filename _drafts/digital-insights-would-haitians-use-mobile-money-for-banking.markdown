In late September, I traveled to Haiti to develop a picture of how some Haitians engage with financial institutions and mobile technology to explore the feasibility of introducing mobile money as an avenue for the provision of financial services. Together with the team from the [USAID/Haiti Finance Inclusive project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/haiti-finance-inclusive-fininc), implemented by DAI, and with support from our sister USAID/Haiti project Finance Pour Tous and two key credit unions – [Caisse Populaire Fraternite (CPF)](https://www.facebook.com/CPFRATERNITE/) and Socolavim – I traveled to 9 locations through the North and Central departments of the country to interview 181 credit union customers as they went about their business at credit union branches.
