Hi, Digital@DAI readers! My name is Inta, and I am the newest staff member at DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration. I come to DAI from GeoPoll, a U.S. registered small business in the mobile for development space. Making the transition from a small business specializing in ICT4D to a large business with a rockstar ICT4D team has given me some unique insights on the needs of small businesses. It has also provided me a big platform (thank you, Digital@DAI!) to share them with others, particularly people working for other major players in the international development sector. Below are some tips for using smaller, specialized technology firms – particularly U.S.-registered small businesses – more effectively in your development projects:

## Get creative…: Working iteratively and collaboratively is the key to a successful relationship with any partner. Smaller, scrappier ICT4D firms are often willing to take bigger risks and try new things, which opens up a whole world of potential innovations. If you have an idea about how to use your partner’s technology in a new way, bring it up! They will listen to your off-the-wall ideas – and if it makes sense, they will make it happen. Who knows, you might have just thought up a whole new product line for your partner.

    ## 1 Tip: Share any ideas with your partner about how to repurpose their 
              technology.
