This December, in honor of the Global Digital Health Forum, we're hosting an ICT4Drinks happy hour in partnership with Tech Change, Vital Wave, and the Digital Impact Alliance. This time, we'll be located at Local 16.

Come celebrate all that is good with technology, global health and international development and network with your fellow peers!

Please [RSVP now](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/december-ict4drinks-tickets-52533689680) and join us to discuss big ideas on little napkins.

First drink on us!
