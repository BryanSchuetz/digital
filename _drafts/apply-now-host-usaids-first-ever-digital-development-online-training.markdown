Within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Global Development Lab, the Center for Digital Development (CDD) addresses gaps in digital access and affordability and advances the use of technology and advanced data analysis in development. DAI’s Digital Frontiers project works closely with the CDD team to roll-out and implement USAID’s Agency-wide Digital Strategy, released in April 2020.

As part of the Digital Strategy, the Digital Skills Initiative is developing trainings and resources geared towards USAID staff to support an increased understanding of, and ability to use digital tools and skills.

The cornerstone of the Digital skills initiative is the Digital Development training, typically 4-5 days and in-person, it provides USAID staff with a holistic overview of digital development -- from the foundations of digital and cross-cutting sectoral focus, to risks and opportunities and implementation strategies. However, due to COVID, traditional training and events have moved to a virtual format.

Today, Digital Frontiers releases a request for proposals (RFP) for experienced organizations to work with Digital Frontiers and USAID to adapt the Digital Development training into an iterative and interactive online training for dissemination to USAID Staff.

## Who Should Apply?

DAI is looking for tech organizations with the following qualifications:

* Experience adapting existing training content into blended multimedia online trainings

* Experience converting a multi-course blended training into multiple individual trainings

* Experience hosting blended trainings on their platform

* Previous experience working with USAID

* Project manager for this activity with experience working with the U.S. Government, preferably USAID

* Familiarity with digital development

* Ability to co-facilitate to participants based in the US and in countries which USAID works

* Ability to work under tight timeframes and successfully meet deadlines
