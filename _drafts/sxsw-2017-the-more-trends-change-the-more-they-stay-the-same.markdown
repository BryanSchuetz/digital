Well, that time of year has come and gone again – The annual [South by Southwest Interactive Music and Film Festival](https://www.sxsw.com/) with all of its thought provoking panel discussions, workshops, keynote speakers and trade fair booths talking about and demonstrating the latest gizmos, gadgets, applications and trends has come and gone – and for the second year, I was in attendance to make some sense of it all.

With hundreds of events over the span of over a week days in multiple locations within downtown Austin, Texas, SXSW’s technology-oriented Interactive Conference can not only be a nightmare to navigate, but also presents a challenge in terms of sifting through the noise and getting a broad picture for emerging trends. Some, such as Virtual- and Augmented Reality jump right out at you through ostentatious displays, while other, tech trends such as blockchain and crytpto-currencies are less obvious.

Last year we wrote a [blog post](https://dai-global-digital.com/sxsw-tech-trends-2016.html) on some of the emerging trends that we noticed while attending SXSW 2016, so this year offered me a chance to compare how these trends have progressed, which have fallen off the map, and which new ones have appeared on the scene. Here are a few key observations:

## Last year, Artificial Intelligence really arrived – This year, it’s already in your house!

A great deal of events at SXSW in 2016 focused on how the explosion of data from cell phones and networks embedded in all sorts of electronic devices have enabled machine learning algorithms to finally be applied to these data sets to be applied to every day use cases like assisting people with shopping online. But it seemed that a lot of programming was still focused on the potential for AI applications. This year has seen an explosion of actual applications from improved customer service through chat bots (another trend alert!) to assisted and even fully automated driving based on sensor data not only from cars themselves, but from all sorts of objects (such as buildings) in the driving environment! And let us not forget, that AI is already in our house, whether obviously (think Amazon Echo’s Alexa) or less obvious (you really think that there isn’t something helping you decide what to watch next on Netflix?). That’s right…intelligent algorithms are already in your life, and they’re watching and learning all sorts of things about you (cool! Or scary?)

## Smart Cities – Yes, the public sector is taking a walk on the cutting edge!

I noticed quite an obvious uptick of discussions, demonstrations and presentations on the growth of Smart City initiatives at SXSW this year. From a fascinating keynote on how our cars in the future will use networked technology from networked sensors around cities to reduce traffic (i.e. time and money wasted) to the Smart Cities Meetup that offered lightning talks from both public sector representatives and private sector players on new partnerships being formed around the country to use Internet of Things technology to address public resource and city management, Smart Cities were everywhere at SXSW2017. It seems that in 2017, the public sector (in particular city governments) are chomping at the bit to partner with private sector network infrastructure and application companies to bring tech and IoT, Big Data and AI to bear on pressing public sector problems. Look out for the next Smart City design competition near you! 

## The elephant has grown up, and it’s getting too big for the room.

Remember last year when we mentioned the tech sector has a diversity problem that isn’t really so secret? Well, it’s still there, and by gosh it seems like we’re reaching a point where it can no longer be swept under the rug. As we continue to increasingly understand the benefits of digital technologies, we are also continuing to learn that the digital gender divide is becoming ever more important. I took a quick scroll through a page of the scheduled programming at SXSW 2017 before going and was immediately struck by how many event headlines focused on terms such as “inclusion” “diversity” and even “bro-culture” in tech. Recognizing a problem is the first step to solving it. It seems as though we are reaching a point where recognition has grown enough to the point that we might expect SXSW2018 to include events that can point to some encouraging progress being made in beginning to actually reducing the problem.

## What does it all mean for us?

I'm excited to see how the rapid integration of "cutting edge" tech like Artificial Intelligence and IoT in the domestic private and public spheres translates over into international development, especially for easy-to-imagine applications such as urban planning and economic development. Our Maker Lab has been integrating IoT into our projects for a few years now, in a one-off demand-driven way. Perhaps a more integrated approach is just around the (Smart City-designed) corner?
