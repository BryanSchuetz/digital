Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies, although still relatively new concepts, are garnering a vast amount of interest in international development across sectors and geographies. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Center for Digital Development (CDD)’s Strategy & Research (S&R) team published a report in 2018, ["Reflecting the Past, Shaping the Future: Making AI work for International Development"](https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/machine-learning/AI-ML-in-development), based on extensive research on this rapidly growing field.

USAID would like to translate the report’s recommendations into an actionable format so the lessons and good practices are accessible to USAID program staff and implementing partners that may have limited familiarity with, nor time, to devote to the topic.

Today, the [Digital Frontiers](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df) team has released a request for proposals (RFP) for qualified firms to work with Digital Frontiers and USAID’s S&R team to create a modular, field-ready guidance product that translates findings from the report into concise, practical guidance for USAID staff and partners.
