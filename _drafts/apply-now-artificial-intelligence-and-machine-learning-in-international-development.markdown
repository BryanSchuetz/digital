Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies, although still relatively young, are garnering a vast amount of interest in international development across sectors and geographies. USAID’s Center for Digital Development’s Strategy & Research (S&R) team published a report in 2018, [Reflecting the Past, Shaping the Future: Making AI work for International Development](https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/machine-learning/AI-ML-in-development), based on extensive research on this rapidly growing field.

USAID would like to translate the report’s learnings and recommendations into an actionable format so the lessons and good practices identified are accessible to USAID program staff and implementing partners who may have limited familiarity with, or time to devote to the topic.

Today, Digital Frontiers releases a request for proposals (RFP) for qualified firms to work with Digital Frontiers and USAID’s S&R team to create a modular, field-ready AI/ML guidance product that translates findings from the S&R Team’s 2018 report into concise, practical guidance for USAID staff and their partners.
