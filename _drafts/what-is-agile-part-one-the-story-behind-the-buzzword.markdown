Agile methodology has been a trending topic for a while now and is used to describe a whole host of approaches to software development, project management, and even [raising children](https://www.ted.com/talks/bruce_feiler_agile_programming_for_your_family?language=en). While it may seem that nearly everyone is working with an agile team or organization, very few know the history of "agile", defined by the Agile Alliance as "[the ability to create and respond to change,"](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/) or what this actually means in practice. This post is the first in series aimed at unpacking this buzzword and how the set of ideas it represents can be used effectively in international development contexts.

## Agile's Origins

To better explain how agile was born, we have to go back a few decades. Traditionally, software development teams used a "waterfall" methodology where each team would work on a task and upon completion, pass it along to the next team, proceeding as such until finishing the project. Starting in the 1990s, however, developers started to push the boundaries of this linear approach and come up with new, more dynamic ways to collaborate. During this time, unique methodologies began to spring up across the software development world, evolving for years in their own communities. This all changed in 2001 when a group of like-minded developers, realizing the commonalities between these various methodologies, drafted the [Agile Manifesto. ](http://agilemanifesto.org/)This manifesto served as a way for developers who believed in this new breed of software development methodologies to come together, find common ground, and organize the principles behind their thinking.

The folks behind the Agile Manifesto chose the word "agile" as a label to capture the mindset and values of adaptation and response to change that characterized so many of the new methods that had emerged. The manifesto demonstrates that agile is a way for teams to conceptualize how they achieve their goals while staying aligned to common themes like collaboration and team dynamics, both of which are core tenets of the manifesto:

*“We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:*

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

**Working software** over comprehensive documentation

**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

**Responding to change** over following a plan

*That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.”*

## Agile's 12 Principles

The Agile Manifesto is supported by 12 Principles that hold true no matter how agile is applied or implemented. These are arguably the most important parts of agile to follow if you plan to utilize it in your work. The Principles are as follows:

 1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

 2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

 3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

 4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

 5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

 6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

 7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

 8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

 9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

One of the beauties of agile is that since it was created by a group of developers who all used different frameworks, strategies, and tools, it is more focused on elevating common values than it is on one prescriptive way to do things. This has helpful applications for the international development community as our work is affected by various contexts and operating environments. In the next part of this series, I will go over some of the different types of agile frameworks and dive deeper into how these concepts and ideas are put into practice.
