Agile methodology has been a buzzword for a while now and it gets used to describe a whole host of approaches to software development, project management, and even [raising children](https://www.ted.com/talks/bruce_feiler_agile_programming_for_your_family?language=en). Everyone loves to say they work on an agile team, to describe their company as an agile organization. While it is true that  this concept has changed the way people work, the details around what it means in practice have started to become diluted to a point that no one really knows what agile means anymore -- even if they know it sounds good. This post is the first in series aimed at unpacking what the buzz is about “agile” and how it can be used effectively in international development contexts.

To better explain how "agile" adapted to its current uses, I’m going to start all the way back at its founding. Traditionally, software development teams used a "waterfall" methodology where each team would work on a task and then pass it along to the next team and so on. Starting in the 1990s, developers started to push the boundaries of the “waterfall” approach and come up with new ways to tackle software development. These different methods and approaches had been evolving for years before they were more formally understood as “agile methodologies”. In 2001, a group of these like-minded developers, drafted the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) giving rise to the concept of "agile" as we know it today. The manifesto was a way for software developers who felt that a new approach to software development was needed to come together, find common ground, and help organize the principles behind their thinking.

The manifesto was more about outlining founders' mindset and values than it is about putting the methodology to use. This approach to structuring the manifesto reflects what agile is all about -- it is not meant to be prescriptive, but rather a way to conceptualize how a team thinks about achieving its goals while staying aligned to common themes. For example, there is a strong emphasis on collaboration and team dynamics in all versions of agile implementation, which you can see is a core tenet of the manifesto:

*“We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:*

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

**Working software** over comprehensive documentation

**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

**Responding to change** over following a plan

*That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.”*

The manifesto is supported by 12 Principles, also developed by agile's founders, which serve to complement and elaborate on what the founders put in the manifesto. These principles are the foundation for whatever form agile takes when implemented and is, in my opinion, one of the most important parts of agile to follow if you plan on trying to utilize it in your work. No matter which form of agile you are working in or how you plan to adapt it, following the principles is the key to knowing you are actually using agile methodologies. The Principles are:

 1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

 2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

 3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

 4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

 5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

 6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

 7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

 8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

 9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

One of the beauties of agile is that because it was founded by a group of developers who were all using different frameworks, strategies, and tools, it is more focused on the common values than it is on any one way to do things.

There are still several versions of agile under the umbrella of the larger methodology. In the next part of this series, I will go over some of the different types of agile frameworks as we dive deeper into how these concepts and ideas are put into practice.
