Raise your hand if you have experienced harassment online. I am sure the response is a virtual flurry. Although digital technologies have the propensity to empower, connect and liberalise; they can also serve as platforms for marginalisation and abuse. 

It is well known that the internet is not a level playing field- women are still as much as [31% less likely](http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2016.pdf) to be online than their male counterparts- and this inequality is reflected in online abuse, with women [27 times](http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2015/cyber_violence_gender%20report.pdf?v=1&d=20150924T154259) more likely to be targeted than men. 

Recent news stories such as those from the [UK General Election](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/05/diane-abbott-more-abused-than-any-other-mps-during-election) have thrown the targeting of female politicians and journalists into the bright lights of public awareness; and high profile cases of cyber bullying of young girls have shocked people world over. Whilst we know well the veracity of online violence, a less prominent issue is how it can exacerbate levels of digital inclusion for already marginalised populations. In this blog we consider how online abuse of women and girls -or “cyber VAWG”- further impedes digital inclusion and prevents women and girls from enjoying digital dividends.
