Less than two weeks ago, on April 21, 2020, [Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/04/21/open-data-campaign-divide/) announced its support for the growing open data movement through the launch of an “Open Data Campaign”. To those unfamiliar with the concept of open data, the significance is unclear. The World Bank uses [the Open Knowledge Foundation’s definition](http://opendatatoolkit.worldbank.org/en/essentials.html) for open data, defining it as data that “can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose.” In practical terms, this means that the data is both *legally* open, publicly accessible or with minimal restrictions, and \*technically \*open, published in electronic formats that are computer readable and non-proprietary. Open data differentiates itself from other concepts like “big data” in that the value is derived from the sharing of the data and its widespread availability, rather than the volume.

**A Brief History**

The concept of open data itself is not new. According to the [Paris Tech Review](http://www.paristechreview.com/2013/03/29/brief-history-open-data/), “open data” as a term first appeared in a 1995 report from an American scientific agency pertaining to geophysical and environmental data, though the concept of knowledge-sharing for public good had long been promoted by some members of the scientific community, recognizing the benefits of freely available research results for building progress.

With the advent of the internet, however, the concept and real-life applications of open knowledge sharing saw new potential, and ideas of how data should be shared, governed, and applied gained new complexities. Since its arrival, the principles of open data have been implemented not just in scientific research contexts, but across varied sectors and actors, including private companies, public governing bodies, NGOs, and individuals.

Though not new, the concept has recently gained momentum, solidifying and growing in popularity and credibility with big-name companies, like Microsoft, and governments showing their commitment to the movement. The merits of the movement and its objective to make data more widely available have been highlighted by the evident [role of data in response to COVID-19.](https://blog.okfn.org/2020/04/16/coronavirus-why-an-open-future-has-never-been-more-important/)

**Who benefits?**

The implications of open data can be seen across a wide variety of sectors and use cases. In some cases, like medical research, the benefits are more obvious. With access to results of other clinical trials, researchers can build upon the findings of others rather than starting anew, or can compare outcomes to confirm the accuracy, reliability, and consistency of results. In times of public health emergencies, such as the Ebola outbreak or the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the real-time sharing of data, such as effective treatments, new outbreaks, and demographic data, help shape a quicker, more effective response.

In other cases, the benefits are less obvious, but nonetheless beneficial. In the financial sector, perhaps the greatest example of open data implementation is the recent adoption of [Open Banking regulations](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/) in the UK, among other European countries. Through this data-sharing mechanism both consumer and society more broadly have greater options as smaller banks and financial service providers are able to enter the market with access to previously guarded data, increasing innovation and competition. In the transportation sector, like medicine, data-sharing has life-saving implications. Every day, traffic collisions between drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and cyclists kill and injure thousands worldwide, constituting not only a public health crisis but an economic and development issue as well. By sharing data, the road safety community can invest in evidence-based policies, create smarter technologies, and [allow for safer and smarter decision-making.](https://www.togetherforsaferroads.org/)

**Open Data and the Private Sector**

Private companies, in comparison to public agencies or individuals, generally possess far more sophisticated, numerous, and comprehensive data sets, but are often hesitant to share. Privacy and legal concerns, the sensitive or personal nature of the data, and fear of losing a competitive edge, and the difficulty of converting the data to a “shareable” format, often drive businesses to keep this info private. Though understandable, this data “hoarding” impedes innovation, and contributes to the increasing concentration of vast amounts of data among a small number of companies. According to [estimates by Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/04/21/open-data-campaign-divide/), fewer than 100 firms collect more than half of all data generated online.

To combat this phenomenon, certain companies, nonprofit organizations, research institutions, governments, and public-private partnerships have begun to promote the value of data-sharing and work to reduce the obstacles, such as the creation of safe, interoperable, data collection and sharing tools. The [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org/), a nonprofit organization and global network of businesses, data experts, and government leaders, “works with companies and governments to build an open, trustworthy data ecosystem.” While the willingness of a company to share data relies on a variety of factors, including the company’s business model, sector in which it operates, regulatory environment, and other considerations, there are several reasons for private companies to engage in data-sharing, both for the common good, as well as [their own success.](https://theodi.org/service/business-data-sharing/) Informing and convincing business leaders, as well as governments and individuals interacting with them, of its value will be key in pushing the movement forward.
