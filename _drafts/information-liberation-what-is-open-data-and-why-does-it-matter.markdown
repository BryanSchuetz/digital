Less than two weeks ago, on April 21, 2020, [Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/04/21/open-data-campaign-divide/) announced its support for the growing open data movement through the launch of an “Open Data Campaign.” Having recently spent several days researching successful open data initiatives, the statement caught my attention. The World Bank uses [the Open Knowledge Foundation’s definition](http://opendatatoolkit.worldbank.org/en/essentials.html) for open data. According to them, open data means data “can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose.” In practical terms, this means data that is both *legally* open, publicly accessible or with minimal restrictions, and *technically* open, published in electronic formats that are computer readable and non-proprietary. This type of data is not to be confused with "big data." As I recently learned, there are differences. For instance, open data derives its value from the sharing of the data and its widespread availability, rather than the volume (as big data does). I won't be spending more time on this particular topic, but if you're interested in learning more, I highly recommend reading a [guest post](https://dai-global-digital.com/should-big-data-be-open-data.html) we published on the subject in 2016.

**A Brief History**

Though I myself only recently delved into the topic, the concept of open data itself is not new. According to the [Paris Tech Review](http://www.paristechreview.com/2013/03/29/brief-history-open-data/), the term “open data” first appeared in a 1995 report about geophysical and environmental data from an American scientific agency. That said,  the concept of knowledge-sharing for public good had long been promoted by  members of the scientific community, who recognized the benefits of freely available research results for building progress.

With the advent of the internet, however, the concept and real-life applications of open knowledge sharing saw new potential, and ideas of how data should be shared, governed, and applied gained new complexities. Since its arrival, the principles of open data have been implemented not just in scientific research contexts, but across varied sectors and actors, including private companies, public governing bodies, NGOs, and individuals.

Though previously established, the concept has recently gained momentum, solidifying and growing in popularity and credibility with big-name companies and governments showing their commitment to the movement. The merits of the movement and its objective to make data more widely available have been highlighted by the evident [role of data in response to COVID-19.](https://blog.okfn.org/2020/04/16/coronavirus-why-an-open-future-has-never-been-more-important/)

**Who benefits?**

The implications of open data can be seen across a wide variety of sectors and use cases. In some cases, like medical research, the benefits are more obvious. With access to results of other clinical trials, researchers can build upon the findings of others rather than starting anew, or can compare outcomes to confirm the accuracy, reliability, and consistency of results. In times of public health emergencies, such as the Ebola outbreak or the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the real-time sharing of data, such as effective treatments, new outbreaks, and demographic data, help shape a quicker, more effective response.

In other cases, the benefits are less obvious, but nonetheless beneficial. In the financial sector, perhaps the greatest example of open data implementation is the recent adoption of [Open Banking regulations](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/) in the UK, among other European countries. Through this data-sharing mechanism, both consumers and society more broadly have greater options as smaller banks and financial service providers are able to access previously guarded data, providing them a chance to succeed in the market. In the transportation sector, like medicine, data-sharing has life-saving implications. Every day, traffic collisions between drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and cyclists kill and injure thousands worldwide, constituting not only a public health crisis but an economic and development issue as well. By sharing data, the road safety community can invest in evidence-based policies, create smarter technologies, and [allow for safer and smarter decision-making.](https://www.togetherforsaferroads.org/)

**Open Data and the Private Sector**

As you might guess, private companies, in comparison to public agencies and individuals, generally possess far more sophisticated, numerous, and comprehensive data sets, but are unsurprisingly frequently hesitant to share this often hard-won information. Various factors, such as legal concerns, the sensitive or personal nature of the data, fear of losing a competitive edge, and the difficulty of converting the data to a “shareable” format, often drive businesses to keep this information private. Though understandable, this data “hoarding” impedes innovation and contributes to the increasing concentration of vast amounts of data among a small number of companies. According to [estimates by Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/04/21/open-data-campaign-divide/), fewer than 100 firms collect more than half of all data generated online.

To combat this phenomenon, certain companies, nonprofit organizations, research institutions, governments, and public-private partnerships have begun to promote the value of data-sharing and work to reduce its obstacles, such as through the creation of standardized, accessible data collection and sharing tools. The [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org/), a nonprofit organization and global network of businesses, data experts, and government leaders, “works with companies and governments to build an open, trustworthy data ecosystem.” While the willingness of a company to share data relies on a variety of factors, including the company’s business model, sector in which it operates, regulatory environment, and other considerations, there are several reasons for private companies to engage in data-sharing, both for the common good, as well as [their own success.](https://theodi.org/service/business-data-sharing/) Informing and convincing business leaders, as well as governments and individuals interacting with them, of its value is a key component in pushing the movement forward.

**Implications for International Development**

As described, the benefits of open data are not linked to one sector or scenario. Rather, the opposite is true, with the increased availability of information transferring benefits in areas as varied as crime reduction to personal finance to environmental protection efforts. International development efforts, spanning these varied sectors and applications, are no different. The importance of open data as part of a comprehensively open approach to development is highlighted by the Principles for Digital Development (guidelines for integrating best practices into technology-enabled development programs) as one of its [nine key tenets.](https://digitalprinciples.org/principles/)

Through open data, as well as open standards, open source technologies, and open innovation, development initiatives can learn from similar efforts, increase collaboration, avoid duplication of efforts, and make the most of new and existing resources. Together, the approach holds the potential to significantly deepen and transform development impact, allowing those concerned with development to view Microsoft's announcement not simply as a corporate initiative but a hopeful indicator of increasing private sector collaboration.
