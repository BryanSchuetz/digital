The Center for Digital Acceleration is excited to announce that we’re taking *MiMuni*, the [open-source](https://github.com/munis-transparencia-gobierno-abierto/municipalidad-de-chiantla) transparency & citizen participation application developed for Guatemalan municipalities, and replicating it for five municipalities in Afghanistan though he [USAID SHAHAR](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/afghanistan-strong-hubs-afghan-hope-and-resilience-shahar) project. The first iteration will be with the Municipality of Kabul.

## Replicating Half Way Around the World

You may ow be asking yourself, “but how can a tool built for Guatemala work in Afghanistan?” This is a fair question, given the inherent risks: differences in language, culture, expectations of an interface, and from an institutional standpoint, a totally distinct system of incentives, governance, and decision-making. We view these differences as features of the process as opposed to hindrances.  In fact, they are the foundations of our entire approach, which we call [citizen-centered design](https://dai-global-digital.com/citizen-centered-design-guatemala.html). In essence, we’re taking the core architecture from the *MiMuni *app in Guatemala, but through our design process,  applying an ethnographic lens to create a new application the represents Afghani local culture, technology adoption and application, as well as the relationship between citizens and their local government.

## Citizen-Centered Design in Afghanistan

First of all, we recruited a dynamite local project manager, who is quick to learn, a skilled networker, and a strong relationship manager. Working with him, we’ve mapped the key actors and stakeholders within the SHAHAR project, Kabul Municipality, the Afghan Deputy Ministry of Municipalities (DMM), local civil society, Afghan’s ecosystem of innovators and technology companies, and made contact with each.

Subsequently, we carried out Frontier Insights research with citizens across 15 of Kabul’s 22 districts, and hosted a design thinking session to bring together our stakeholders, get them to talk to each other, and surface specific ideas for the app’s appearance, content, and functions. With this information, we put together a design proposal that will be shared with all the same key actors to ensure buy-in and a feeling of ownership of the process.

Once we've made adjustments based on feedback from stakeholders, the design proposal will become a scope of work that SHAHAR's procurement team will use to help us hire a local software developer. That developer will take our open source code from Guatemala and replicate it accordingly.

`Frontier Insights in Kabul`

Taking a step back,  *Frontier Insights* is a key component of our design approach. It helps us understand how citizens communicate, how they seek and share information, how they use technology, and gives us a sense of what they expect from their municipal authorities.

In Kabul, we carried out 120 interviews, of which 70 were men and 50 were women. We made a push for gender equality, which—as we learned—is a challenge in a place where women are less likely to agree to be interviewed in the street, and if so they agree, would rather be interviewed by another woman. We accounted for this by building our interview team of both men and women. While the interviewees did not turn out to be 50/50, we’re happy with the result.

`Frontier Insights in Kabul`

In terms of geographic diversity, we interviewed people in 15 of Kabul’s 22 districts. Once again, we didn’t hit them all, but we gathered a broad sample. Is the data collected a scientifically representative sample of everyone in Kabul? No, but keep in mind that *Frontier Insights* is designed to help us make early decisions in our design process; we’ll keep researching, iterating, and improving our solution throughout the process through our design thinking sessions and user testing.

So what did we find?

## 1. In Kabul, the incidence of both mobile phones and smartphones is high, but not universal

 97% of respondents had a mobile phone of some type or another, and 56% had a smartphone of some type. This gives us confidence that a smartphone app will have an audience, but it also pushes us to think about how an SMS component might complement the app to help the municipality reach those who do not own a smartphone and vice versa.

## 2. TV, radio and Facebook are popular sources of news

Among our respondents, almost everyone said that they got their news from television, while about half said that they used the radio and Facebook on their mobile phone to get news. To us, this gives us a sense of how to reach people when we get to the promotion stage. It’s also interesting to see Facebook rival radio as the second most popular news source, since this is also the case in many of the places where we’ve carried out *[Frontier Insights](https://dai-global-digital.com/tags/?tag=digital-insights)* research, and mirrors realities at home in the US.

## 3. People love Facebook and Viber

We asked our respondents to name their three favorite apps. Unsurprisingly, their favorite app was Facebook, followed by—surprisingly—Viber. In most places we work, WhatsApp is a close second, but in this case it came in third, followed closely by Messenger, Instagram, and (another surprise) imo. Our respondents also reported using Facebook an average of 77 minutes per day. Based on these findings, we’ll be looking for ways to promote our app via Facebook, Viber and Whatsapp, but also  look for some simple ways to integrate our app with these social popular social tools. We designed something similar in Guatemala, where citizens are able share what they find in the budget section of the application with their friends via popular messaging tools or choose post them to Facebook.

## 4. People visit the municipality to pay property tax or get a business license

The property, or safaye, tax was by far the most common reason people visit the municipality. Respondents also mentioned visiting the municipality to get a business license, get an ID, and other housing documents. Based on this, we’re exploring the possibility of building into the app a capability to make safaye payments. Separately, we’ve been told that the business license process will no longer sit with the municipality, so we plan to provide some information about how to get the license in the app, rather than a digital license process.

## 5. The municipality’s current citizen feedback and request mechanisms need work

Of our 120 respondents, only 29 reported previously submitting a formal complaint about a local issue (bad roads, trash pick-up, etc…) to their municipality. Of those 29, only 5 felt that their issue was resolved. Improving citizen engagement is a core objective of the SHAHAR project, therefore, as part of the app design we’ll be working with the project team (that’s helping improve the municipality’s citizen report mechanisms) to incorporate a feature allowing SHAHAR staff to send and integrate reports, from the app, directly to the systems  SHAHAR is building.  Our goal is that the app-based reports will look the same to municipal staff as reports shared in person, over the phone, or any other way.

## Design Thinking as Triangulation

![IMG_3614.jpg](/uploads/IMG_3614.jpg)
`Our design thinking session at the SHAHAR office`

We ran these sessions much the same way as the workshops we [facilitated in Guatemala](https://dai-global-digital.com/forking-with-design-thinking-in-guatemala.html) last year. We had small groups generate and vote on ideas, present those to the full group, and then the full group vote on the best ideas. Beyond the opportunity to surface ideas from the bottom-up, we view these sessions as an a chance to have the actors and institutions to meet each other face-to-face and understand each others’ interests and preferences. Like *Frontier Insights*, none of the suggestions or ideas we collect are definitive; instead we triangulate and put together a draft concept that will pass muster for our own gatekeepers within the SHAHAR project and within the municipality (principally the mayor himself, who is only one voice, but an important one).

![IMG_3618.jpg](/uploads/IMG_3618.jpg)
`Participants discuss their ideas for the Kabul app`

In terms of appearance, we’ll use the municipality’s current color scheme, dark blue and gold, as a base, but we also wanted citizens to make suggestions for additional colors to use. While this may not seem important, we view it as a simple way to incorporate feedback and ideas from citizens that will be highly visible in the final product and generate ownership. At the end of the design thinking sessions, the participants chose orange and green as accent colors; orange for the color of the vests the municipal employees wear, and green to represent vegetation. Eventually, we’ll have to think on how to artfully incorporate these with a base color scheme of blue and gold.

`A participants votes on ideas during a plenary session`

For content, participants asked us to include municipal contacts, development plans, some information about budgets, some statistics about Kabul, an organizational chart, information on key laws and local ordinances, as well as news updates and information on touristic and historic sites in Kabul. Of course, our ability to incorporate this information will hinge on its availability, but we are proposing to include as much of it as we can, since most of it is static content that doesn’t require a back-end connection to a database.

![IMG_3711.jpg](/uploads/IMG_3711.jpg)
`A participant votes on her favorite ideas`

In terms of functions, participants asked for the ability to share reports directly to the municipality, but also to get feedback on their report. They wanted a safaye and business tax calculator, the ability to pay the safaye tax directly, and access to municipal job listings. As mentioned above, we are confident that we’ll be able to integrate the app into the citizen reporting mechanism that SHAHAR is developing for Kabul. We’re also confident that we can do a tax calculator. The municipal job listing will depend on the municipality’s current processes for posting jobs online and if there is already a place where this information is available. As for the safaye payment component, we have seen significant interest in this component also from the mayor’s office, and are exploring the technical challenges involved.  We’ve heard that UN HABITAT is building a database of safaye payments, which we would need to leverage, but we’re not sure when it will be ready, so we may end up pushing this component to a round 2 of development.

## Where to go from here?

Based on the result from Frontier Insights and our design thinking session we’re putting together our design proposal and socializing it with all the key actors. In the next week or so, we hope to have a finalized scope of work, which we’ll use to hire a local software developer and get to work. At the same time, our local project manager is starting his engagement of our four provincial municipalities, where we’ll conduct Frontier Insights and host some design thinking sessions so we can develop their municipal apps as well. We expect to finish the development of the Kabul app and the four provincial apps by October of this year, and possibly earlier, since we are starting with pre-existing source code. We’ll keep you updated on the progress of our process!
