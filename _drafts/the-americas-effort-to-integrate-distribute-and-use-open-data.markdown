I was happy to represent DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration in the [AmeriGEOSS week](https://www.amerigeoss.org/amerigeoss-events/amerigeoss-week-2018/index_html) in Brazil in August, sharing experiences of how DAI has develop platforms and tools for decision making in Central America.

[AmeriGEOSS](https://www.amerigeoss.org/amerigeoss/index_html) is a framework that seeks to promote collaboration and coordination among the [GEO members](https://www.earthobservations.org/members.php) in the American continent, “to realize a future wherein decisions and actions, for the benefit of the region, are informed by coordinated, comprehensive and sustained Earth observations and information”.

We met at the [INPE (Brazilian Institute for the Space Research) ](http://www.inpe.br)and the AmeriGEOSS team presented the [Datahub](https://data.amerigeoss.org).

## **A Good Starting Point: Not Starting From Scratch**

The group found that the amount of data that the AmeriGEOSS members produce was huge and requires an open storage and distribution tool. They choose [CKAN (Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network)](https://ckan.org),  a web-based open source management system for the storage and distribution of open data. Being initially inspired by the package management capabilities of Debian Linux, CKAN has developed into a powerful data catalogue system that is mainly used by public institutions seeking to share their data with the general public.

With this datahub they support the AmeriGEOSS framework that seeks to promote collaboration and coordination among the GEO members in the American continent, “to realize a future wherein decisions and actions, for the benefit of the region, are informed by coordinated, comprehensive and sustained Earth observations and information.” **Certainly this is where the good intentions and technology meets to make things happen.**

## **Open Data, Open Government, the Connection with the Americas**

With over 344.000 datasets, 37 organizations and 40 working groups, and a catalogue of maps, tools and applications for the decision making, the AmeriGEOSS Datahub presents itself as a good effort for data and geospatial information source for the Americas. Some of the applications available are:

* EcoExplorer: A web application that allows you to explore the data underlying the World Ecophysiography Map.

* [Sentinel](https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-2) Explorer: An application demonstrating analysis of Sentinel-2, 10m Multispectral, Multitemporal, 13-band images with visual renderings and indices. The imagery is sourced from Sentinel-2 on AWS. This application is in beta release.

* [Sentinel](https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-2) 2 (NDVI): Sentinel-2, 10m Multispectral, Multitemporal, 13-band images with visual renderings and indices. This Imagery Layer is sourced from the Sentinel-2 on AWS collections and is updated daily with new imagery.

* Imagery – [Landsat8](https://landsat.usgs.gov/landsat-8): The most recent imagery from Landsat 8. This band combination (6 5 2) is good for agricultural studies, as healthy vegetation will appear bright green.

`The hub has more than 344 thousand datasets, which are included by GEO members.`

Most of this information can be used directly in the navigator tool and / or download it for other purposes, and the best… is free.

The countries had uploaded a wide range of information in the platform for different sector purposes, that goes from risk management, health, cartography, transportation and many other. Many of the information available came from the current countries “open-data” efforts.

## **The challenge: Create Community and Engage the Users**

The the AmeriGEOSS  technology allow us to integrate information and data form multiple sources and distribute it via different channels (data visualization, artificial intelligence, apps, maps, alerts, etc). The knowledge management and learning process represent a challenge to those who manage these platforms. Better user engagement, and real user benefit, will happen when we meet the user’s requirements; definitely AmeriGEOSS is going in the right direction but more efforts and interactions with national and regional organizations have to happen in order to fully reap the technology's benefits at the human level.

A few days ago, Google launch the [Google Dataset Search (Beta), ](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch)an interface that enables users to find datasets stored across thousands of repositories on the Web, making these datasets universally accessible and useful. The contents in the AmeriGEOSS Datahub are already indexed; the Google interface will make sure the hub is available to connect with the user in need of this information.
