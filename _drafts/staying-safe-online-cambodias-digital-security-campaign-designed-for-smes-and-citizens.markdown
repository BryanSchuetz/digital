As COVID-19 drives more people online for work, entertainment, and even connection to friends and family, digital and data security issues are increasingly important across the US and around the world. However, citizen-focused digital and data security discussions are still in early stages in some countries, especially in Southeast Asia, and my home base, Cambodia. So - who really gets left behind? It is often the citizens and small businesses that rely on digital tools, but do not all have strong cyber skills, to safely do business online.

As of 2020, more than 9.7 million Cambodians are online and using social media – well over half of the population. Most connected Cambodians access the internet via mobiles, and a 2016 survey reported that many surveyed see Facebook as *the* internet. However, as penetration grows, Cambodians don’t always get access to the information they need, or skills training support, to stay safe online. In April 2020, the early effects of COVID-19 on Cambodia’s SMEs and citizens were evident, especially through a digital security lens. Scams, hacking, and fake news schemes targeted vulnerable users and used fear to generate confusion and panic, especially with users that we unfamiliar with all the features of their phones and Facebook pages.

Through the USAID Asia Digital Asia Accelerator (also known as the Accelerator), a regional initiative that aims to increase the safe and appropriate use of digital technologies across the region, we conducted a rapid assessment of this dynamic digital security environment with SMEs, security specialists, and business support organizations. We learned about a series of common problems and security-related challenges that Cambodian users face online, especially when using smartphones. We heard devastating stories about hacking, businesses losing access to business networks and contacts, and elaborate online scams built to prey on trusted contacts and networks. Perceptions of trust and safety are important themes here in Cambodia, something we see across much of the digital “insights” work DAI does around the world, like this [recent research](https://dai-global-digital.com/what-are-user-perceptions-of-internet-trust-and-privacy-in-india-and-ghana.html) in India and Ghana.

While it is impossible to ensure everyone stays absolutely safe, the Accelerator team knew we needed to take steps to give Cambodians information they can use to protect themselves. One of the best ways to reach people in Cambodia right now, especially during the pandemic, is through short video-based messages, and disseminating messages on Cambodia’s most ubiquitous social media site, Facebook. The DAA team included Cambodian experts from the DAI-run USAID Development Innovations project, and they rapidly build out the campaign concept based on DI’s [successful campaign experience](https://dai-global-digital.com/using-social-media-to-build-community-and-advance-your-projects-goals-tips-and-tricks-from-development-innovations.html), and the team’s experience running viral campaigns in Cambodia like [Think Plastic](https://www.facebook.com/ThinkPlasticNow/) and [Stay Home](https://www.facebook.com/stayhome11/). The Accelerator used findings from the rapid assessment with small business users to design the initial Online Safety campaign (#OnlineSafetyKH), and then worked with partners at the USAID Information Safety and Capacity Project, MSME support organization SHE Investments, and the USAID We Act and Innovations for Social Accountability (ISAC) projects to test and refine messages. It was essential to get rapid feedback from local actors that supported SMEs and understood digital security challenges to ensure videos were practical and user-friendly, and resonated deeply with the Cambodian audience. As a result, our team developed a series of ten videos with “tips and tricks”, a popular outreach methodology in Cambodia, to help SMEs protect themselves online. Each video was designed to address specific problems that Cambodian users face such as weak passwords, challenges downloading apps directly onto their phones, or suffering from online scams, but we have heard anecdotally that the simple messages in the videos are also providing useful tips to users in nearby countries.

We are now halfway through the campaign. To date, early videos are attracting more than 50,000 – 90,000 views each, and they are some of the most shareable content on our partners’ sites, showing that the information is resonating with Cambodian users. Published videos are available on [USAID Cambodia’s Facebook playlist](https://www.facebook.com/USAIDCambodia/playlist/1220181051657840/), or via this google drive. Initial response tells us that these tips are resonating with Cambodian users, and in time, we believe the videos will prompt more Cambodians to take steps to protect themselves, their data and their devices as the country, and its small business sector, continues to transform digitally. Stay tuned to this blog for final campaign results, feedback from the audience, and lessons learned.
