When I first began learning about digital development, I thought of it as the new frontier of development. A frontier that could push international development out of its modus operandi by providing individuals, communities, governments, and organizations with access to new sources of information at rapid speeds, enabling new means of collaboration to propel development objectives forward.

Digital technology is unique for two reasons. First, digital is *informative*—providing users with increased access to new information and opportunities at their fingertips. Second, digital is *informed*—enabling users to input information that will conceivably be used by industries and governments to tailor and update their products and benefit their business and economies to improve their customers' experiences.

An example of this virtuous circle is the [Coffee Cloud](https://dai-global-digital.com/coffee-cloud-precision-ag-at-the-touch-of-a-button.html), an application DAI developed in collaboration with coffee producers, government institutions, and research institutes in response to a decline in coffee production in Central America. Coffee producers input specific information about their crops into the app (*digital informed*) and receive customized advice to improve crop management; this information is shared with other coffee farmers as well as the government coffee institute and meteorological services (*digital informative*), which in return use the information for predictive modeling that can then be shared back to coffee producers.

## The Realities of Digital

While digital development has the potential to transform industries such as coffee and alter the status quo, the more I engage with digital the more I’ve come to see it as an instrument of development. Digital cannot magically leapfrog all the underlying economic dynamics, social norms, and barriers preventing people in developing countries from accessing vital services or improving their economic situations.

Let’s look at gender inclusion, or lack thereof, as an example. When you look at global levels of mobile phone access, a common metric for measuring digital inclusion worldwide, it’s clear that more women lack access to mobile phones than men. According to the [GSMA 2019 Mobile Gender Gap Report](https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/blog/the-mobile-gender-gap-report-2019/), women are 10 percent less likely than men to own a mobile phone (28 percent less in South Asia where the gender gap is the highest) and 23 percent less likely than men to use the mobile internet. Furthermore, the report cites the largest barriers for women are affordability, digital literacy, and perceived lack of relevance, meaning that information is not targeted to their needs and thus they are not compelled to digitally engage. All this is to say, as the world shifts increasingly into the digital space, so too have the gender barriers that have prevented women from contributing to their households, communities, and economies for centuries.

## Barriers

I recently visited DAI’s project team is digitizing Haiti’s health systems (through the [Strategic Health Information System Program](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/haiti-strategic-health-information-system-his-program)), through the National Unified Health Information System (SISNU) and funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development. The team works with the Ministry of Health and Finance to digitize public and private clinics across the country, enabling staffers to input patient information, track and monitor instances of tuberculosis, HIV, and other diseases, and improve treatment and care. When considering the project goals, the team considered: how do we disaggregate data between men and women? Can the data help analyze how men and women are treated by location? Can disease prevalence, treatment, or visit frequency data be broken out and analyzed by gender? And, what is done with the information?

In conversations with the team, I learned that the project has several deliverables focused on gender integration and many of the indicators are indeed disaggregated by sex. While this is critical, getting buy-in from governments and institutions to implement gender-inclusive activities remains a challenge. Even though digital technologies empower the government to access and centralize information from health clinics across Haiti—*which is momentous on its own right*—age-old social norms can still hinder true change of equitable access to healthcare.

So, what can be done? Social norms, like gender roles, are complex, and digital development provides us with access to new means of communication and sources of data that can help us tell a deeper story. What we choose to learn from and do with that information is powerful and can inform how we develop new technologies, implement policies, distribute resources, and engender inclusive platforms. In the case health data, disaggregating and reporting on woman’s healthcare experiences in comparison to men’s can be the first step to changing these norms.
