Have you ever suffered the consequences of someone else's online gaming habits? Maybe it was your college roommate playing World of Warcraft mere hours before your 8:00am exam, your partner choosing Call of Duty over date night with you, or your child’s “hidden” Candy Crush play under the dinner table as you tried to ask about their day. It is not unheard of for frequent gaming to negatively affect one’s ability to focus, productivity at work, or social relationships. In fact, in 2018 the World Health Organization even recognized “[gaming disorder](https://www.who.int/news/item/14-09-2018-inclusion-of-gaming-disorder-in-icd-11)” among the addictive disorders included in its 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) when the pattern of behavior results in significant distress or impairment in “personal, family, social, educational or occupational functioning”.

The global gaming market, which spans causal mobile games to immersive other world simulations, brought in [$177.8 billion in revenue](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/global-games-market-to-generate-175-8-billion-in-2021-despite-a-slight-decline-the-market-is-on-track-to-surpass-200-billion-in-2023/) last year, a 23% increase from 2019. A market of this size holds incredible potential and raises the question, is gaming inherently bad? Are there opportunities to harness the captivating (and addictive) aspects of this trend for good?

**Applications in Education**

Companies are eager to leverage the gaming market in the education sector, including the growing adoption of [esports in schools](https://www.viewsonic.com/library/education/esports-schools-good/). Last week, on November 15th, Roblox Corporation announced a [$10 million investment](https://www.wsj.com/articles/roblox-looks-to-bring-educational-videogames-to-schools-11636988400) for non-profits to develop games for middle school, high school and college students in areas that include robotics and computer science. This move signaled the company’s interest in expanding their user platform – which merges the gaming experience with entertainment, social media, toys and digital currency – with an eye toward the next generation of the internet, the [metaverse](https://www.wsj.com/articles/metaverse-experience-facebook-microsoft-11636671113?mod=article_inline). Education has the potential to play a big role in the metaverse, allowing students to have immersive, 3D virtual (and cost effective) experiences such as visiting the ancient pyramids of Egypt, stargazing in a planetarium, or dissecting a frog.

Use of computer games in school settings is not new. Elder millennials will remember some of the earliest applications of classroom computer games (on floppy disk!) such as Number Munchers and the [generation-defining Oregon Trail](https://socialmediaweek.org/blog/2015/04/oregon-trail-generation/). In the decades since, the applications of digital games in the classroom have expanded and evolved in sophistication, only increasing in prevalence with the remote and hybrid learning models that became the norm in 2020.

The education sector represents a significant tranche of U.S. foreign assistance, with over [$1B in funding](https://foreignassistance.gov/) obligated to the “Education and Social Services” sector in fiscal year 2019. But applications go much further, as education and learning is incorporated across sectors in the form of capacity building and knowledge transfer. Other applications include multi-sectoral preparedness and response simulations, such as for coordinating government response to a natural disaster or disease outbreak.

**Applications in Cybersecurity**

Gamification is already in use for cybersecurity learning, both for security awareness initiatives (teaching security principles to non-security professionals), as well as cybersecurity training and education to cultivate security professionals. In an [interview with InfoSec](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5idXp6c3Byb3V0LmNvbS84NDA2ODIucnNz/episode/QnV6enNwcm91dC03NzIyODU2?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwjYwdnWsbD0AhUVrHIEHdW4CrEQjrkEegQIAhAF&ep=6), Jessica Gulick, leader of Katzky Consulting and Commissioner of the US Cyber Games, notes several benefits of gamification for security professionals and their employers:

1. It offers a hands-on way for security professionals to gain exposure to the latest cyber threats in a safe environment where they can gain experience hacking, essentially breaking things, in order to learn how to fix them. It is not safe place to “play” or hack on the internet (and in fact, there are very real consequences for doing so).

2. The elements of competition, as well as teamwork, are highly relevant for the field and help advance professional development faster than a traditional classroom bootcamp. Cyber games such as Capture the Flag or “[CTFs](https://www.cyberwarrior.com/cw-ctf-hacking-while-gaming/)” expose employees to different environments and threats than what they see in their daily work. These exercises provide an opportunity to sharpen their skills and awareness, ultimately adding more value to the company that employs them.

3. Cybersecurity competitions and e-sports can provide an opportunity for scholarships, networking, and resume builders such as Digital Badges. It also offers name recognition in an arena where unknown hackers are known to expose a vulnerability in government or high-profile company website to make a name for themselves.

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) named cybersecurity as a development challenge in its [Cybersecurity Primer](https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/usaid-cybersecurity-primer) released last month. While cybersecurity has long been an interest of the U.S. Government (essentially since the existence of computers), it is much more recent that it has been a priority for USAID programming. With the increase in digitalization of systems and the [associated risks to critical infrastructure](https://dai-global-digital.com/impact-of-the-us-and-eu-in-critical-infrastructure-digitalization-and-cybersecurity-in-the-western-balkans.html), cybersecurity is now being incorporated into international development both as a key consideration in projects across sectors (e.g. health, and governance). There has also been a rise in dedicated digital projects and cybersecurity initiatives, such as those under the interagency [Digital Connectivity Cybersecurity Partnership](https://www.state.gov/digital-connectivity-and-cybersecurity-partnership/) and the USAID-funded Ukraine Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure Activity and the newly awarded [Critical Infrastructure Digitalization and Resilience](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/regional-critical-infrastructure-digitalization-and-resilience-cidr) project, both implemented by DAI.

A common objective in donor-funded cybersecurity programming is to build the capacity of the workforce, establishing a pipeline of qualified cybersecurity and IT professionals equipped to meet the country’s needs. In fact, this is a problem the U.S. faces as well. The Washington Post recently reported that there are approximately [377,00 unfilled cybersecurity jobs in the U.S.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/26/us-cyber-workforce-gap-is-getting-bigger/) and 2.7 million globally. In most contexts, the evolution of cybersecurity threats far outpaces the process of reviewing and updating university curriculum. Traditional classroom coursework is not enough to prepare graduates to support the needs of employers in government or the private sector. Providing opportunities for regular hands-on, simulation-based learning environments such as [cyber ranges](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2018/02/13/cyber_ranges.pdf) is key to equipping students and security professionals alike to meet real-world defense and detection needs.

Cybersecurity education games already exist for students as young as elementary school aged, such as [Google’s Interland](https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us/interland/kind-kingdom). While promoting such curriculum in schools won’t produce the workforce results donors expect within the span of a 5-year program, it may just be the surest way to bolster the pipeline of future cybersecurity professionals to fill the gaps that are needed in the U.S. and globally.
