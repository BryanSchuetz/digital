Most people have experienced negative consequences of online gaming habits. Maybe it was your college roommate playing World of Warcraft mere hours before your 8:00am exam, your partner choosing hours of Call of Duty over quality time with you, or your child’s “hidden” Candy Crush play under the dinner table as you tried to ask about their day. It is not unheard of for frequent gaming to negatively affect one’s ability to focus, productivity at work, or social relationships. In fact, in 2018 the World Health Organization even recognized “[gaming disorder](https://www.who.int/news/item/14-09-2018-inclusion-of-gaming-disorder-in-icd-11)” among the addictive disorders included in its 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) in cases where the pattern of behavior results in significant distress or impairment in “personal, family, social, educational or occupational functioning”.

The global gaming market, which spans causal mobile games to immersive other world simulations, brought in [$177.8 billion in revenue](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/global-games-market-to-generate-175-8-billion-in-2021-despite-a-slight-decline-the-market-is-on-track-to-surpass-200-billion-in-2023/) last year, a 23% increase from 2019. A market of this size holds incredible potential and raises the question, is gaming inherently bad? Are there opportunities to harness the captivating and addictive aspects of this trend for good?
