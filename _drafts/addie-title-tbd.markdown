Have you ever experienced negative consequences of online gaming habits? Maybe it was your college roommate playing World of Warcraft mere hours before your 8:00am exam, your partner choosing hours of Call of Duty over quality time with you, or your child’s “hidden” Candy Crush play under the dinner table as you tried to ask about their day. It is not unheard of for frequent gaming to negatively affect one’s ability to focus, productivity at work, or social relationships. In fact, in 2018 the World Health Organization even recognized “[gaming disorder](https://www.who.int/news/item/14-09-2018-inclusion-of-gaming-disorder-in-icd-11)” among the addictive disorders included in its 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) in cases where the pattern of behavior results in significant distress or impairment in “personal, family, social, educational or occupational functioning”.

The global gaming market, which spans causal mobile games to immersive other world simulations, brought in [$177.8 billion in revenue](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/global-games-market-to-generate-175-8-billion-in-2021-despite-a-slight-decline-the-market-is-on-track-to-surpass-200-billion-in-2023/) last year, a 23% increase from 2019. A market of this size holds incredible potential and raises the question, is gaming inherently bad? Are there opportunities to harness the captivating and addictive aspects of this trend for good?

**Applications in Education**

Companies are eager to expand their gaming market share into the education domain, including the growing adoption of e-sports in schools. Last week, on November 15th, Roblox Corporation announced a [$10 million investment](https://www.wsj.com/articles/roblox-looks-to-bring-educational-videogames-to-schools-11636988400) for non-profits to develop games for middle school, high school and college students in areas that include robotics and computer science. This move signaled the company’s interest in expanding their user platform – which merges the gaming experience with entertainment, social media, toys and digital currency – with an eye toward the next generation of the internet, the [metaverse](https://www.wsj.com/articles/metaverse-experience-facebook-microsoft-11636671113?mod=article_inline). Education has the potential to play a big role in the metaverse, allowing students to have immersive, 3D virtual (and cost effective) experiences such as visiting the ancient pyramids of Egypt, stargazing in a planetarium, or dissecting a frog.

Use of computer games in school settings is not new. Elder millennials will remember some of the earliest applications of classroom computer games (on floppy disk!) such as Number Munchers and the [generation-defining Oregon Trail](https://socialmediaweek.org/blog/2015/04/oregon-trail-generation/). In the decades since, the applications of digital games in the classroom have expanded and evolved in sophistication, only increasing in prevalence with the remote and hybrid learning models that became the norm in 2020.

The education sector represents a significant tranche of U.S. foreign assistance, with over [$1B in funding](https://foreignassistance.gov/) obligated to the “Education and Social Services” sector in fiscal year 2019. But applications go much further, as education and learning is incorporated across sectors in the form of capacity building and knowledge transfer. Other applications include multi-sectoral preparedness and response simulations, such as for coordinating government response to a natural disaster or disease outbreak.
