Digital Frontiers’ Digital Asia Accelerator (DAA) is launching the Women’s Digital Inclusion Challenge to find partners across the Southeast Asia region who have delivered successful digital upskilling programs for women and SMEs. The Challenge targets organizations looking to scale their operations to reach new countries and communities.

Micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) [represent](https://www.ilo.org/empent/whatsnew/WCMS_749275/lang--en/index.htm) more than 70% of global employment and 50% of GDP. With the onset of COVID-19, small businesses have been hit the hardest, and the gender digital divide has continued to widen. In Southeast Asia, the pandemic has disproportionally affected women-led companies due to increased unpaid domestic care duties, shrinking earnings, and decreasing access to resources due to curfews, restrictions, and lockdowns. Despite the urgent need to digitize their businesses due to the pandemic, many women-led SMEs (WSMEs) don’t have access to digital skills training and digitalization support designed for them. Despite increased affordability and [70%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/487965/internet-penetration-in-southeast-asian-countries/) internet penetration in Southeast Asia – [11%](https://webfoundation.org/2020/03/the-gender-gap-in-internet-access-using-a-women-centred-method/) fewer women than men are online. Men are 21% more likely to be online than women – this likelihood rises to 52% in the world’s least developed countries. This [gender internet use gap](https://solutionscenter.nethope.org/resources/closing-the-gender-digital-divide) is due to cost, skills, time, relevance, and safety concerns. Although there are numerous models of successful digital skills training and support for WSMES in the region, many organizations focus on just one country and face funding gaps and sustainability challenges.

`Digital Asia Accelerator's partner Agile Development Group provided digital skills training and coaching support to disability support organizations and women entrepreneurs with disabilities in 2020`

To address this issue, Digital Frontiers, through the Digital Asia Accelerator, has released a request for applications (RFA) to fund the expansion of these successful models to other countries in Southeast Asia. As a result of this Challenge, WSMEs digital capabilities will strengthen and improve their ability to engage in the digital economy. In addition, Challenge partners will have expanded operations to serve new SME segments and countries across the region.
