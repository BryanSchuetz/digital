The technology revolution in Nigeria is remarkable compared to that of many other countries in Africa (the continent completely skipped the landline stage of development!). As one of the top destinations for investment in Africa, Nigeria is home to booming tech start-ups that provide a conducive and innovative environment for entrepreneurs across sectors. Powered by the Nigerian government's commitment to digital access, the digital ecosystem in Nigeria is likely to evolve further. Within this context, DAI Nigeria hosted two roundtables in Lagos and Abuja on April 3 and May 2. The focus of the discussions included current trends in the Nigerian digital ecosystem within the framework of  DAI’s VP of Technical Services Brigit Helms’ new book, [Access for All: Building Inclusive  Economic Systems.](https://www.dai.com/news/access-for-all-dais-brigit-helms-launches-her-new-book-on-economic-inclusion)

The Lagos roundtable on April 30 centered around the lack of social inclusivity of digital access in Nigeria. It highlighted the inspirational growth of tech start-ups by young people through hubs like the [Co-Creation Hub](https://cchubnigeria.com/) in Yaba and [Stonebricks](http://stonebrickshub.com/) Hub in Abuja, as well as a discussion on government action needed to support the needs of the small business in the technology sector.

The panelists at the Abuja roundtable on May 2 included influential individuals like Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, the Director General and CEO of the [National Information Technology Development Agency ](https://nitda.gov.ng/nit/)and Deputy Director and Head of the Macroeconomic Policy Division of the [Central Bank Nigeria](https://www.cbn.gov.ng/), Ms. Ladi Bala Keffi. Their conversation focused on a call for greater IT development, regulation and policy, data ownership, cyber security, privacy, digital job creation, and financial access and inclusion.![nigeria pic.jpeg](/uploads/nigeria%20pic.jpeg)`Picture from the Abuja Roundtable on May 2, 2019.`

## Key Take-Aways

There were several key takeaways from the discussions, and while not revolutionary findings for digital development practitioners, it’s important to continue highlighting these issues and their persistence especially in countries like Nigeria, where the technological advancement is far beyond most other countries on the continent.

* **Gender inequality** in Nigeria is a significant barrier to digital access for Nigerian women. Women, especially those who are lower income, less educated, and live in rural areas, are tacitly discouraged from having personal bank accounts, land ownership, and educational training , This limits them from benefiting from digital services like digital banking and e-commerce. However, 60 percent of Nigeria’s GDP is represented by the unpaid work that women do. For example, the domestic work that many women are socially/culturally responsible for constitutes a significant portion of household budgets. This issue calls for a widespread shift towards gender inclusion, especially in digital access.

* The progress of mobile access is surpassing that of digital access, although this plateaus among economically and financially excluded populations. \*\*Expanding mobile access \*\* is an opportunity to reach these populations not just to give access for access sake, but rather to enable access to the tools and services that come with owning a mobile phone, including the internet. The government representatives on the panel unanimously agreed that there is a clear need for policies that incentivize increasing broadband penetration, especially in rural communities.

* The Central Bank of Nigeria recently revised the National Financial Inclusion Strategy to permit telecommunication companies to lead the implementation **mobile money** in the country. Prior to this policy reform, only banks could administer mobile money, alienating people who did not have bank accounts. Now, anyone with a cellphone can access mobile money using their phone number.

* **Informal ICT training and skills development** for young people is essential to capacitate the next generation workforce in Nigeria. Currently, the demand for ICT products and services far outweighs the supply of labor in the country with the skill sets needed to fill these demands. This means that companies are looking outside the country to acquire the tech skills they need to support their business. As Hanson Johnson highlighted in our [blog](https://dai-global-digital.com/a-resolution-to-support-the-tech-sector-where-we-need-it-most.html) earlier this year,  there are initiatives supporting local tech talent to grow. Given the high demand for these skillsets, there is an opportunity for young people interested in ICT across Nigeria to fill the labor market gap.

## Looking Forward

The takeaways outlined above are just some of the many barriers to and opportunities for digital access that are apparent in Nigeria. The roundtables demonstrate that the Nigerian government and the private sector are committed to improving digital access, as the technology sector continues to grow in the country. As policies are enacted, the Nigerian government's commitment will ideally translate into action that positively impacts the communities disproportionately affected by limited digital access. To date,  Nigeria has made great strides in becoming a tech leader in the region. Undoubtedly,  more targeted efforts for inclusion will only help this effort, engaging millions more in the fast-paced global economy. Our hope is that these roundtables are just the beginning of the conversation.
