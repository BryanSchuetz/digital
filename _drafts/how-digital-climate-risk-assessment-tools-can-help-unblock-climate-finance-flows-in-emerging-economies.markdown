Frequently, climate finance that flows through national financial systems to smaller financial institutions can get stuck. Larger commercial banks that receive funds from major investment banks, accredited by the Green Climate Fund, often seek smaller financial institutions in local markets to syndicate this climate finance.  However, smaller institutions often lack the tools to appraise risk and begin lending, despite the essential role they play in syndicating climate finance. Mispricing of climate-related risks can result in the knock-on effect of mispricing assets, and ultimately the misallocation of capital. Therefore, assisting these institutions with adequate portfolio risk assessment and facilitating the right risk transfer of physical and financial liability risks requires further investment.

To support businesses ability to appraise climatic risk, DAI has designed a digital **Climate Tool for Assessing Risk and Preparedness (Climate TARP).** The Climate TARP is a web-based app informed by DAI’s experience working at the intersection of increasing access to finance and developing adaptable, scalable technology. The tool helps acceleratethe application of digital technologies even in data-thin markets due to its focus on the design of the flow of information for decision-making, and not merely on technology.

Having been developed under the framework of the [Principles for Digital Development](https://digitalprinciples.org/), the Climate TARP implements a user-centred design methodology and utilises an open-source technology stack – ensuring high potential to be sustainable in the medium and long term. The platform is completely self-managed by the host, which allows for design of an evaluation framework according to the most relevant climate risk indicators

To provide a balanced approach to the risk and preparedness analysis, the Climate TARP assesses portfolio vulnerability from three different perspectives:

* Business information and its relationship with the investment portfolio;

* Geo-location of the business analysed from the climatological perspective of probability of occurrence of an event relevant to the sector; and

* Level of preparation demonstrated by the client and the client site to assimilate climate adaptation technologies and techniques.

Implementing a customised climate risk and preparedness assessment using the Climate TARP is a simplified process. The first stage is focused on information Collection (see Figure 2 below). Key information is collected on the client, their geolocation, their business, the sector they operate in, and any additional information required (for example, for a loan application).

Climate Cards (pictured below in Image 3) are then generated that reveal historical climate risks, with GIS-powered risk maps based on the location and sector of the information provided to the assessor. These climate cards frame the climate risk analysis and transition the assessment towards a targeted set of questions that evaluate the client’s climate preparedness for each climate card.

This approach differentiates the Climate TARP from a typical index measure, or other unidimensional analysis. In taking this three-pronged approach, the Climate TARP ensures that it addresses all three pillars of sustainability :

* **Economic**: based on the business information gathered, to better equip the FI in making sound financial decisions;

* **Environment**: utilizing available location-specific climate data that enables the assessment of climate risk, and for 0climate adaptation measures to be financed and implemented; and

* **Social**: in not only creating access to finance for improved climate adaptation, but also creating client trust and social buy-in through the primary climate preparedness data, which makes clients aware that they can contribute to their climate risk profile, and not just passively stand by as their site and business get judged.

The report that is generated as the final output of running an assessment, presenting clear risk profiles for each climate card, with compelling visual elements that illustrate both climate risk and context (partially pictured below, Image 4). An overall climate risk rating of Low/Medium/High is the key decision-making output and is calculated numerically through a weighted scoring of business information, climate information, and customer preparedness. Also provided as part of the report are a simple breakdown of the ratings for each of the components that comprise it.

The design of the Climate TARP is robust in a number of ways and features a forward-looking design that allows customisation and upgrading. Firstly, each institution using the tool can tailor the financial information requested as part of the client and business information steps. Second, the tool’s climate data can be updated to ensure that the most recent climatological information is used in the assessment, especially as new data or new sources become available. Additionally, it allows for the updating of climate data to the most granular information available, as data quality improves and pixel sizes – i.e. the size of the physical area for which climate risk is quantified – shrink. 

Further customisations can be made to refine the questions and information collected during site visits client to gauge climate preparedness. This includes the scope for a climatologist or sector specialist to be brought in to improve the criteria and risk indicators utilized. Lastly, while the Climate TARP is currently configured as a climate smart tool for finance, the architecture of the software allows for the tool to not only be circumscribed to climate information, but also for the assessment of other geological or health risks and preparedness. Integration with management information systems and core banking systems allows this tool to be mainstreamed and provide complementarity to objectives of digitising operational processes.

Applying this approach can help unblock climate financial flows towards those that are producing the food we eat and providing the tourism experience that we are all craving in these pandemic-affected times.
