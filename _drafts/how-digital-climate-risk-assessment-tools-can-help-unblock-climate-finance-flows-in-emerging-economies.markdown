Climate finance is getting stuck.

Large commercial banks that receive funds from major investment banks accredited by the Green Climate Fund typically seek smaller financial institutions in local markets to syndicate these funds. However, smaller institutions often lack the tools to appraise risk and begin lending, meaning that funds allocated towards the fight for climate mitigation, resilience building and adaptation are not being adequately disseminated and applied.

As part of the [InterAmerican Development Bank’s EcoMicro](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/belize-idb-ecomicro-project) portfolio of climate mitigation and adaptation programs, supported through a partnership with the Government of Canada, DAI has designed a digital **Climate Tool for Assessing Risk and Preparedness (Climate TARP),** a web-based app conceptualised from DAI’s experience working at the intersection of building access to finance and developing adaptable technologies. By providing a balanced approach to risk and preparedness analysis, Climate TARP assesses portfolio vulnerability from three different perspectives:

* **Business information and its relationship with the investment portfolio**: Using Climate TARP to implement a customised climate risk and preparedness assessment is a simplified process. The first stage is focused on information collection (see Figure 1 below). Key information about the client is collected including their geolocation, their business, the sector they operate in, and any additional information usually required for a loan application.

* **Geo-location of the business and the probability of the occurrence of a relevant climate event**: Based on the geographic and sector-related information provided to the assessor, Climate TARP generate Climate Cards (pictured below in Figure 2), which some of the historical climate risks the client can expect, along with GIS-powered risk maps. These Climate Cards inform the climate risk analysis and help focus the assessment on a targeted set of questions that evaluate the client’s climate preparedness for each potential climate risk.

* **Level of preparation demonstrated by the client to adopt climate adaptation technologies and techniques**: Climate change is not new a new concept for loan applicants, many of whom have already taken actions to increase their adaptive capacity in the face of climate variability and change. Climate TARP offers credit institutions the option to acknowledge these actions when assessing risk and resilience. The report that is generated as the final output of running an assessment, presents clear risk profiles with compelling visual elements that illustrate both climate risk and context (partially pictured below, Figure 3). An overall climate risk rating of Low/Medium/High is the key decision-making output and is calculated numerically through a weighted scoring of business information, climate information, and customer preparedness. The report also provides a simple breakdown of the ratings.

The design of Climate TARP is robust in several ways and features a forward-looking design that allows customisation and upgrading. First, each institution using the tool can tailor the financial information requested from the applicant. Second, the tool’s climate data can be updated to ensure that the most recent climatological information is used in the assessment, especially as new data or new sources become available.  Further customisations can be made to refine the questions and information collected during site visits to gauge an applicant's climate preparedness. This includes the scope for a climatologist or sector specialist to be brought in to improve the criteria and risk indicators utilized. 

Lastly, while Climate TARP is currently configured as a climate smart tool for finance, the architecture of the software allows for the tool to not only analyze climate information, but also assess other geological or health risks and related levels preparedness. Integration with management information systems and core banking systems allows institutions to mainstream these tools and provide complementarity to objectives of digitising operational processes.

Applying this approach can help unblock the flow of climate finance to those that are producing the food we eat and providing the tourism experiences that we are all craving in these pandemic-affected times.
