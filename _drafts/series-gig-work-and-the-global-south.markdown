It’s finally spring here in DC and I feel like a new woman. Whether due to the warm weather, longer days or the feeling that the U.S. might finally be turning a corner on the pandemic (emphasis on *[might](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/health/covid-herd-immunity-vaccine.html)*), I feel like I finally have the space in my brain to re-engage on some important social and political issues, and think about how they connect to the work I do here at DAI’s Center for Digital Acceleration. Though I have every intention of revisiting my long abandoned series on digital food environments (I haven’t forgotten!), over the next several weeks I’d like to take a look at digital platforms, gig work, and what they might mean for the digital economy and livelihoods in the Global South.

## Why Gig Work? 

As I learned while conducting research in support of the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor’s (CGAP) report on XXXXXXXX, gig work, and digital platforms more broadly are becoming more permanent fixtures in the global digital economy, especially in countries in the Global South where the likelihood of securing decent, formal, full-time, salaried work is becoming more and more of a challenge. As digital platforms enter the marketplace, offering opportunities for people to maintain mixed livelihoods, consisting of various income-generating activities patched together across formal and informal spheres of work, it will be important for those of us in the digital development space to understand the challenges and opportunities that digital platforms and the gig economy may present in the countries where we work. Over the course of this series, I will look at the political and social impacts of digital platforms and their business models, study how workers in the global south are engaging with these opportunities, and identify ways that the development industry might ensure platform work remains a safe and decent options for workers around the world. I hope you’ll stick around for this series and I welcome comments and feedback along the way!

## Part 1: What Prop 22 Might Mean for Platform Workers

To begin this discussion, I’d like to take us back to November 2020, a day when the American people made a pretty pivotal decision (and no, not the one you’re thinking…)

While many of us were waiting on pins and needles for the results of the United States Presidential election, California voters decided to pass Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that determined app-based drivers, such as those that work for Uber, Lyft and other delivery service platforms like DoorDash, to be independent contractors, not employees or agents of the companies they provide services to. Uber, Lyft and DoorDash are reported to have collectively spent over $200 million dollars in support of the initiative, making it one of the most [expensive referendums in California history](https://www.latimes.com/projects/props-california-2020-election-money/).

## What is Prop 22 and How Did It Come to Be?

Prop 22 came on to the scene in response to California’s Assembly Bill 5 (AB 5), passed in 2019, which sought to help determine whether workers should be considered independent contractors or employees. Clearly making this distinction is important because being a legally-recognized employee, as opposed to a contractor, helps determine the type of benefits one is eligible for, if not legally bound to receive. This can include benefits such as healthcare, unemployment insurance, sick leave and a minimum wage. AB 5 helped make this determination via the ABC test, which presumes a worker is an employee **unless**:

*A) The person is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of the work and in fact.*

*(B) The person performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business.*

*(C) The person is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as that involved in the work performed.*

By these standards, it was questionable whether digital platforms like Uber and Lyft could pass the ABC test. This debate played out publicly through a lawsuit against Uber and Lyft. According to the California Attorney General, the two companies could not pass the ABC test because:

*(A) The companies control which drivers receive which ride requests and how much the drivers can charge,*

*(B) The work that drivers perform is not outside the usual course of business, but rather at the core of \[Uber and Lyft’s\] business… and*

*(C) Drivers are not engaged in their own business but rather transport passengers for Uber and Lyft.*

In August of 2020, a judge found Uber and Lyft to be in violation of AB5 and the California AG compelled the companies to correctly classify their workers as employees. The companies responded strongly to the ruling, citing the harm it would bring to their drivers, who, according to Lyft representatives, did not want to be employees and value the independence and flexibility gig work offers.

While appealing the law in court, both companies threatened to suspend service in California if forced to classify their workers as employees. Ultimately, instead of resolving the issue in court, the companies introduced and sponsored Proposition 22 to bring the debate to the public. California voters were asked to decide whether or not app-based drivers, [defined](https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_22,_App-Based_Drivers_as_Contractors_and_Labor_Policies_Initiative_(2020)) as, \*“Workers who (a) provide delivery services on an on-demand basis through a business’s online-enabled application or platform or (b) use a personal vehicle to provide prearranged transportation services for compensation via a business’s online-enabled application or platform,” \*should be considered employees and independent contractors.

## An Uber Expensive Campaign

The ride-hailing and delivery service platforms unleashed the full power of their marketing dollars to convince voters and drivers alike that passing the resolution was in their best interest. Uber and DoorDash alone spent over $110 million on the ballot measure. Additionally, Uber pushed out messages to its drivers about the ballot measure through its app featuring messages such as “Prop 22 is Progress” and warnings about the perils of a no vote. After some drivers’ sued to put a stop to the messages, citing “political coercion,” [a judge denied a request for a temporary restraining order](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21539902/uber-drivers-lawsuit-tro-court-reject-prop-22-app), ruling that Uber could continue to send such messages through their platform. Similarly, Instacart reportedly asked workers to include pro-Prop 22 stickers into customers’ orders, while DoorDash provided restaurants with [free pro-Prop 22 delivery bags](https://www.kqed.org/news/11842964/gig-companies-are-making-their-workers-promote-prop-22). (I don’t think that this is the right point to discuss the ups and downs -- or downs and downs -- DoorDash’s relationship with restaurants, especially during the pandemic, but let’s just say that it is [fraught](https://www.eater.com/22228352/convenience-of-delivery-apps-destroying-restaurants-uber-eats-doordash-postmates).) When all was said and done, Proposition 22 passed last November, a major victory for rideshare and delivery platforms.

## The Aftermath

Though Prop 22 did not reclassify app-based drivers as employees, it does now require that they are provided with certain benefits not previously available such as healthcare subsidies and a wage floor that is [120 percent above the minimum wage](https://thecounter.org/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-gig-economy-election-2020/). These wage protections, however, only apply to drivers’ engaged time, meaning that they are not paid for any time spent waiting for new rides (this would be like if DAI didn’t pay me for the time I spent in the bathroom, making coffee or toasting up a bagel in the kitchen…RIP Bagel Mondays).

While labor advocates have vowed to continue the legal battle against these tech firms and Prop 22, the impact of the decision is already being felt across the state. In January of this year, Albertsons’, the second largest grocery chain in the country, some of its subsidiaries, and other grocery stores such as Vons and Pavillion, [opted to replace their full-time employed drivers with DoorDash gig workers](https://www.newsweek.com/california-proposition-22-albertsons-vons-drivers-laid-off-outrage-twitter-1558939), or contractors, leading to substantial layoffs. Critics of Prop 22 have noted that this is just the beginning of the impact that the ballot initiative will have, not only in California, but across the country as Uber and its peers in Silicon Valley have publicly announced their intentions to seek out and support similar initiatives in other states. Uber’s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi is [quoted](https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_22,_App-Based_Drivers_as_Contractors_and_Labor_Policies_Initiative_(2020)) as saying, “Going forward, you’ll see us more loudly advocate for new laws like Prop 22,” and that Uber looks to “work with governments across the U.S. and the world to make this a reality.”

One must only look across the pond to the United Kingdom to see that the ridehailing and delivery tech giants might face some resistance in their quest to pursue similar campaigns. Back in March, the U.K. Supreme Court ordered Uber to classify its drivers as workers (or for comparison to Prop 22, employees). The litigation, which took about five years going through the Employment Appeal Tribunal, the Court of Appeals and then the Supreme Court, concluded with Uber being required to put in place a minimum wage, holiday pay and pension for roughly 70,000 drivers. Labor advocates have noted loopholes similar to those underlying the Prop 22 win. Drivers are only compensated for “engaged time” and may be prevented from working for more than one app at a time. Though the tribunal ruling only applies to ridehailing platforms, major food delivery companies in the UK, Deliveroo and Just Eat are facing “an existential threat” (Eater London), with Deliveroo reportedly setting aside GBP 112 million to cover “anticipated legal challenges on its riders’ employment status.

## Worker Status and the Digital Platform Business Model

As a food media junkie, I’ve been tracking the drama surrounding Prop 22 since last year when outlets like Eater reported Uber and Lyft’s threats to suspend service in California if forced to classify their drivers as employees. At the time, I didn’t fully grasp just why reclassifying drivers as employees posed an “existential threat”. The linkage between drivers’ worker status and the success of these companies came to mind again recently when U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh [expressed support](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-us-labor-secretary-says-most-gig-workers-should-be-classified-2021-04-29/) for gig workers’ classification as “employees”, causing Uber’s shares to fall by 8 percent and Lyft by 12 percent. This led me to question once more the link between drivers’ worker status and the viability of these companies’ business models. Particularly in

A September 2020 article from Grub Street, titled “Another Reminder to Stop Using Delivery Apps” has begun to give me a clearer picture. In addition to slamming platforms such as GrubHub, DoorDash, Postmates and Caviar for their [treatment of struggling restaurants during the pandemic](https://www.grubstreet.com/2020/05/nyc-caps-delivery-fees-at-15-percent.html), writer Chris Crawley calls into question the very nature of the business model that these companies are built upon. He writes:

*The thing about companies like DoorDash, Postmates, and Caviar is they don’t appear to make much business sense. ...The people running these start-ups are “waiting to establish a dominant market position,” in which they can raise prices to become profitable, but “the problem with this view is that ‘the future’ never seems to come.”*

What Crawley is referencing here are some of the ingredients that digital platforms, whether delivery-related or otherwise, need to be profitable. In my next blog, I’ll try to figure out whether or not these ingredients inherently fly in the face of fair treatment and protections for the workers that power these platforms.
