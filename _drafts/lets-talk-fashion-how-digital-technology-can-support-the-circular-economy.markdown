The fashion industry drives a significant part of the global economy. Valued north of [$3 trillion](https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&context=mgdr), the fashion industry – defined by the [United Nations Alliance](https://unfashionalliance.org/) as clothing, leather, and footwear – accounts for 2% of the world’s gross domestic product. The sector responsible for employing over 300 million people worldwide – many of whom are women – and providing goods indispensable to human welfare is also responsible for around [8-10% of carbon emissions](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340635670_The_environmental_price_of_fast_fashion), nearly [20% of global wastewater production](https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/03/1035161), and about [9% of microplastic losses](https://www.fashionrevolution.org/our-clothes-shed-microfibres-heres-what-we-can-do/) to the ocean annually. The [circular economy in design](https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/topics/circular-economy-introduction/overview) that tackles climate change and biodiversity loss is based on three principles: eliminate, circulate, and regenerate. Although retail companies have increased their sustainable investments over the past five years, the progression remains slow in shifting to transparent and sustainable fashion standards.

While climate change threatens all populations, communities in low- and middle-income countries feel its impact first and worst. The onset of the COVID-19 crisis has powered global eco-awakenings; consumers are now, more than ever, urging fashion players to be more socially and environmentally responsible through all stages of the fashion production life cycle. While far from the target of taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, digital technologies offer innovative solutions to tackling climate change.
