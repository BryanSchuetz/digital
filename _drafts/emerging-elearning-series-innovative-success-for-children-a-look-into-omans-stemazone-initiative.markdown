This is the first in a series of blog posts that seek to capture some of these efforts, celebrate innovative successes, consider critical lessons learned, and support practitioners who continue to do this work.

## Bringing Child-focused Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM) Content to eLearning

The [*stemazone*](https://stemazoneoman.om/ar/#section-1) initiative for Omani youth—funded by the private foundation Eshraqa, and designed and implemented by DAI—was always intended to be cutting-edge. Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM) education is considered fundamental to support the development of a knowledge economy, something that the Sultanate of Oman has prioritized for the coming years. Intended to encourage children and youth to get directly involved in STEAM activities, this project originally had a detailed plan to carry out in-person, hands-on workshops for youth. With widespread restrictions on people gathering in 2020, the project had to pivot quickly. But how?

The main challenge was to transform that in-person experience into a virtual one, in a very short timeframe, with an exceptional level of quality as the first program of its type in Oman. When the [Sustainable Business Group](https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/sustainable-business) shared this idea with the CDA team, the ideas and proposals began to flow. In a matter of approximately six months, a platform with cutting-edge, culturally appropriate content went live. It is now an award-winning learning environment that continues to be actively used by Omani teachers and learners.

This was not an easy process. Our team went through significant trial and error to launch, improve, and maintain the site and its contents. Eighteen months after the platform launch, we would like to share some key lessons learned, thinking about one central question: What is the best way to create an innovative, child-focused, remote learning experience quickly? 

## Considerations for bringing STEAM to new audiences through eLearning

We consider the following points as key elements of our success in creating a remote learning environment to support STEAM learning experiences, using Moodle as the learning management system (LMS).

**1. Keep it accessible, with comprehensive tracking.** 

User experience design is key to success for eLearning, especially for children. As adults, we are often dazzled by futuristic, fancy, or complex interfaces, when the target audience might need something simpler. For the stemazone project, significant time and effort went into determining the right balance. For example, it was important for the platform to capture intake information on students, but the reality is that children are not necessarily able to answer comprehensive demographic information. Finding the right fit there took multiple iterations and testing.

Additionally, eLearning is more than just the content a user engages with, such as well-produced videos or pedagogically appropriate lessons. For example, it’s important for all eLearning content to be SCORM (Shareable Content Object Reference Model) compliant. When content is SCORM compliant, that allows project managers to more easily track and manage data to understand how well the online courses are working.

**2. Scalable and secure infrastructure.** 

Stemazone serves students, children, and young people nationwide in Oman. Through partnership with a local information technology (IT) provider, we were able to ensure high availability of content, a quick connection to servers, and flexible infrastructure to respond to spikes in platform demand. The level of security in data and system access should never be underestimated, and it’s important to, for example, consider the implementation of security layers like two-factor authentication.

**3. Consider different modalities of STEAM learning as complementary and additive.** 

While the digital stemazone platform was created in response to pandemic restrictions, a hybrid program generated more engagement among learners. STEAM education in particular is highly tactile, based on building and experimentation. Having step-by-step guidance at home, and participating in some in-person activities, allow learners to experience the best of both worlds. 

Therefore, different types of partnerships may be necessary to successfully implement these different types of modalities. For example, working with the Omani Ministry of Education has been crucial for this hybrid transition, strategically complemeting work done in partnership with the Oman Children’s Museum and the Omani Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Youth.

## Good results with transformative vision

A year after it was launched, the [*stemazone*](https://stemazoneoman.om/) eLearning initiative was a big winner at the Future Skills and Human Resources Development Conference 2021 in Muscat, Oman. The Arabian Research Bureau ARB/OITE presented awards to Eshraqa—the social development arm of Omani conglomerate Khimji Ramdas—in three categories: “Future Technology,” “Robotics,” and “Best of the Best.” In 2022, *stemazone* will be part of a broader STEM learning ecosystem, continuing to support Oman’s youth and the productive future of the Sultanate of Oman.
