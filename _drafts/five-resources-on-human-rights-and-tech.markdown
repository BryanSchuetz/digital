This Tuesday 10th December marked the 71st anniversary of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/), a founding document which set out, for the first time, fundamental human rights to be universally protected. Working in international development, most of us are well aware of and committed to the 30 rights laid down in the UNDHR. Each country has numerous legal frameworks which are relevant to the digital space and aim to protect citizens- such as laws related to privacy and data protection – however, these are not always aligned with the most recent technological advancements. In the humanitarian and development sectors, we are [digitizing faster than the legal and ethical frameworks](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/future-financial-assistance-outlook-2030-enaresfr) governing this digitization. There is some fear that the technology sector remains [virtually a human-rights free zone](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25156).

In order to be able to protect human rights, we need to fully understand what this looks like in a digital world, and mandate responsibilities, accountability, beyond non-binding ethical frameworks and guidance notes. Indeed, in the recently released “[contract for the web](https://contractfortheweb.org/principles/principle-3-respect-and-protect-peoples-fundamental-online-privacy-and-data-rights/)”, Tim Berners Lee outlines a principle for the internet: “respect and protect peoples fundamental online privacy and data rights”.  He asserts that these protections must be underpinned by rule of law, and applicable to all people and data.
 
The examples of technology being used in the violation of human rights are endless. One example, is the case of Huduma Namba in Kenya, a national ID registration system which was mandated by the Court to make registration voluntary and benefits not conditional on registration. Compulsory biometric registration was seen as a violation of the right to privacy, the right to equality, and the right to non-discrimination, as well as the right to public participation. There are numerous examples of [social media](https://www.freedomonthenet.org/report/freedom-on-the-net/2019/the-crisis-of-social-media) platforms being used for surveillance or electoral manipulation, but there are also arguments that social media are irresponsible in their very architecture. For instance, the algorithms that manipulate our access to information may disadvantage one person over another in a job search or provide only one side of the story during civic strife. Do they abuse our human rights in their very design?

The recognition that technology platforms can be inherently abusive, or can be used to disadvantage those more vulnerable, is increasingly recognised. Accordingly there are numerous calls on developers to ensure that human rights are intrinsic to design, using processes such as human-centered design to properly assess risks, needs and wishes of the target audience. 

We could share an endless list of recommendations covering the 30 rights, from privacy to freedom of expression. But here are five articles and reports that we have read recently, that have sparked our thinking in this area:

## 1. Report of the Special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights on the digital welfare state
The report presents the almost dystopian future we are stumbling into. He raises concerns that, despite numerous analysis of human rights implications of technologies such as AI and biometrics, no protections are currently grounded in law. 

## 2.Omidyar Network Ethical OS
The guide to anticipating the future impact of today’s technology. The aim of the guide is to help makers of technology, product managers and others see problems begore they arise. It aims to help with good design, providing a comprehensive list of potential risks that need to be thought about upfront.

## 3.Engineering and lawyering privacy by design: understanding online privacy both as a technical and an international human rights issue. 
Adamantia Rachovitsa outlines why privacy – as a fundamental human right – is not just a human rights issue, but should be a design feature of technological solutions. 

## 4. Human rights by Design: The Responsibilities of Social Media Platforms to Address Gender‐Based Violence Online. 
This article argues that online gender-based violence cannot be addressed by government legal systems, but need to be address by technology companies in their very design.

## 5. Algorithms and Human Rights by the Council of Europe
The report does what I just didn’t have space for in this article: it goes through human rights from “fair trial and due process” to “freedom of expression” and outlines how algorithms can impact on human rights. It’s a long read, but worth it for those wanting to really dig into the topic.
We hope to continue the conversation on human rights in the ICT4D space. Tweet us at @DAIGlobal and @ChloeMessenger any reading you recommend.
