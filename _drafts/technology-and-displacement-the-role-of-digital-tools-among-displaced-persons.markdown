In a [previous post](https://dai-global-digital.com/in-honor-of-womens-history-month-exploring-the-gender-digital-divide.html?utm_source=related-box) from March of last year, I wrote about the reality of the gender digital divide, in which I noted the difference in digital access and usage among women and men globally and the lost potential that results from this lack of access. When able to access, understand, and leverage digital tools, women are able to use these tools to better both their own economic outcomes as well as those of their families and communities. However, women are not the only group facing the reality of the digital divide. The [UN Secretary-General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation,](https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/assets/pdf/Roadmap_for_Digital_Cooperation_EN.pdf) a report presenting strategies for inclusive, equitable adoption of digital technologies, notes some of the many other groups affected by similar challenges, including “migrants, refugees, internally displaced persons, older persons, young people, children, persons with disabilities, rural populations, and indigenous peoples.”

While there is much to be said about digital access among all of these groups, I was interested in this post to specifically explore digital usage among refugees and displaced persons. How do these groups access and use digital tools? What are the greatest barriers they face in doing so? What kinds of special considerations need to be taken for these users? The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) [Global Trends Forced Displacement in 2020](https://www.unhcr.org/flagship-reports/globaltrends/) Report estimates that there was a total of 82.4 million forcibly displaced people worldwide by the end of 2020. With nearly 7.8 billion people in the world at the end of 2020, this number represented more than 1 percent of the world’s population.

**How do displaced persons use digital tools?**

Like other users, forcibly displaced people can use technology to access information, connect to resources, access funds, or communicate with others. In reading more about [digital solutions](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR4300/RR4322/RAND_RR4322.pdf) to aid displaced persons, I was reminded of many of the same solutions that have arisen during the COVID-19 pandemic for the broader population. Refugees and displaced people, like many in the pandemic, value from being able to stay in touch with far-away family, receive remote health services, utilize forms of digital identification to access resources, or continue an education or job in which showing up to a physical location is no longer an option. (See the team’s [blog post](https://dai-global-digital.com/frontier-insights-colombia-understanding-childrens-digital-access.html) detailing CDA’s recent work to explore how digital tools can be better leveraged for children’s education in conflict-afflicted communities.)

**Barriers and challenges**

Refugees and internally displaced persons, however, face additional compounding obstacles specific to their situations that may be both assisted or exacerbated by technology. Online services and applications, such as [Refunite,](https://refunite.org/) [RefAid](https://refaid.com/), [The Welcome Card,](https://thewelcomecard.org/) and [Ankommen](https://www.bamf.de/EN/Themen/Integration/ZugewanderteTeilnehmende/ErsteOrientierung/AppAnkommen/app-ankommen-node.html) (German for “arrive”), among others, can help refugees overcome language barriers, manage unfamiliar legal processes, and navigate everyday needs in their new location. However, making use of these tools and more basic services like checking email or sending WhatsApp messages are reliant upon the [components of access](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinero/2020/02/05/when-it-comes-to-tech-refugees-need-more-access-not-more-apps/?sh=46c1791420bc) that are often out of reach, such as reliable Wi-Fi, affordable data plans, electricity, and devices to connect. According to [UNHCR’s refugee statistics](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/), developing countries host 85% of the world’s refugee population, with Least Developed Countries hosting 27%, exacerbating access gaps that already exist in many of these places.

When they are connected, displaced people may be particularly vulnerable to scams, misinformation, or disinformation that targets their particular situations. An [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/22/world/europe/belarus-migrants-facebook-fake-news.html) from the New York Times late last year describes the way in which false opportunities spread on social media lured migrants to the Belarussian-Polish border with false promise of entry into the EU, only to endure long days in harsh conditions with no forward progress. The reality of “[digital litter](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/digital-litter-downside-using-technology-help-refugees)” also feeds into this problem. Digital litter includes applications, links, or other online resources that have not been kept up and are no longer relevant. Though well-intentioned in their initial creation, these outdated resources add to the confusion and misinformation that displaced people face, and have the potential to lead individuals into wasted or potentially dangerous actions if the information is no longer true.

**The importance of inclusion**

These realities only touch the surface of the numerous and varied challenges that forcibly displaced people face when navigating their journeys from initial displacement to resettlement. The efficacy of digital tools to improve lives and create opportunities for displaced people has been proven, but as outlined in the [UN Secretary-General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation](https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/assets/pdf/Roadmap_for_Digital_Cooperation_EN.pdf), it is vital to recognize the different between technological advancement, and *inclusive *technological advancement. Leaving certain populations marginalized from digital tool access exacerbate existing inequalities, not only disadvantaging individuals in these groups at present but harming communities at large as the divide between those with access and those without widens. As we in the development community think about digital solutions, it is vital that we keep this reality in mind to best address the unique needs and vulnerabilities that displaced persons and other disadvantaged groups face when seeking to better their situations through digital tools.
