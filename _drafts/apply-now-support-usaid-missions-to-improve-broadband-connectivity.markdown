The rapid expansion of mobile and internet access in the developing world holds the promise of becoming a platform for resilient economic and social growth. However, the availability and cost of connectivity is becoming a significant barrier to fully realizing that vision.

To help address this challenge, USAID’s Center for Digital Development developed the [Better Connectivity, Better Programs: How to Implement a Demand Aggregation Program (How-to Guide)](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/15396/Better_Connectivity_Better_Programs_April2018.pdf).

Today, DAI’s USAID-funded Digital Frontiers project releases a request for proposals (RFP) for experienced organizations to help USAID implement the [Better Connectivity, Better Programs: How to Implement a Demand Aggregation Program (How-to Guide)](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/15396/Better_Connectivity_Better_Programs_April2018.pdf). Selected organizations will support USAID missions to aggregate the internet, mobile, and telecommunications demand of their implementing partner programs. This will assist USAID’s implementing partners in obtaining improved broadband service in currently underserved areas and negotiating better price and service levels. DAI anticipates awarding this as an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) with issuance of Cost Reimbursable (CR) or Time and Material (T&M) Task Orders.

**Who Should Apply?**

DAI is looking for qualified organizations with experience analyzing national or regional telecommunications landscapes, negotiating internet, mobile, or telecommunications service agreements in developing countries, and working with USAID and implementing partners.
