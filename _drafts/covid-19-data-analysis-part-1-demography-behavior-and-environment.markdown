### *[Click here](https://dai-ictgeo.github.io/covid_19_part_1/) for the full analysis*

*This article was authored by Gratiana Fu, with contributions from Greg Maly and Jamie Parr. The analysis will be updated as we receive additional data.*

**Background**

As COVID-19 continues to spread across the world, one of the greatest challenges to response efforts is a lack of data and evidence about infection and mortality rates. We will learn more about the virus and the populations most at risk as test kits arrive in the hands of physicians. Ideally, this information will be used to target response efforts at populations most in need, guide policy decisions, inform the donor community, and support decision-making by organizations whose work spans multiple countries. As a global development company with projects [all over the world](https://www.dai.com/extras/maps/index.html), this kind of information is invaluable as we think about ways to support our staff and prepare for what comes next.

Information from the earliest confirmed cases of COVID-19 indicates that some groups of people are at a higher risk for infection than others. Public health organizations like the WHO and US CDC have [released warnings](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) for those at higher risk to take extra precautionary measures. To help DAI and other global development organizations better understand vulnerabilities in the communities in which they work, the DAI Global Health and the Center for Digital Acceleration are tracking these risk factors, in addition to other potential correlates to mortality rates.

In this first of a multi-part series, we will keep an updated record of demographic, socio-economic, personal health, and environmental factors that are perceived to being correlated with heightened risk of mortality, and identify known country and subnational datasets that can help us identify regions at risk. We will supplement this analysis with charts and maps. This document will be updated over time.

# **Theories**

*NOTE: THIS SECTION WILL BE UPDATED AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT RISK FACTORS*

Below is a list of factors that have emerged as known drivers of increasing risk of mortality. Some of these theories are based on information released by official public health bodies while others are factors that could be proxies. As we learn more about possible drivers from the medical community, we will update this analysis with new datasets when possible.

1. [Factor 1: Age](https://dai-ictgeo.github.io/covid_19_part_1/#Factor-1:-Age) - People over the age of 65\+ are at higher risk ([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html))

2. [Factor 2: Smoking](https://dai-ictgeo.github.io/covid_19_part_1/#Factor-2:-Smoking) - People who smoke are at higher risk ([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html))

3. [Factor 3: Air Pollution](https://dai-ictgeo.github.io/covid_19_part_1/#Factor-3:-Air-Pollution) ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/17/air-pollution-likely-to-increase-coronavirus-death-rate-warn-experts)) - People living in countries with higher air pollution are at higher risk

4. Factor Grouping 4: Medical Conditions: People who have serious chronic medical conditions are at higher risk. These conditions include:

   1. [Heart disease](https://dai-ictgeo.github.io/covid_19_part_1/#Medical-Condition-A:-Cardiovascular-Disease) ([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html))

   2. [Lung disease](https://dai-ictgeo.github.io/covid_19_part_1/#Medical-Condition-B:-Respiratory-Condition) ([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html))

   3. [Diabetes](https://dai-ictgeo.github.io/covid_19_part_1/#Medical-Condition-C:-Diabetes) ([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html))

   4. [Hypertension](https://dai-ictgeo.github.io/covid_19_part_1/#Medical-Condition-D:-Hypertension) ([Bloomberg News](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-09/top-virus-doctor-says-high-blood-pressure-is-major-death-risk))

# **Datasets & Analysis**

Our analysis pulls from publicly available datasets from a variety of official and reliable data sources. We have aggregated the datasets outlined below, as well as others, in a googlesheet. For the sake of transparency and collaboration, this [dataset is public](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eeg9dpIlP9jENJsp-cWY51Kw8fojpLnh6mhxORCTPL8/edit?usp=sharing).
