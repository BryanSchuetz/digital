A recent report prepared by the [Amazonian Geo-referenced Socio-Environmental Information Network (RAISG) ](https://www.amazoniasocioambiental.org/es/)and [InfoAmazonia](https://infoamazonia.org/es/), in coordination with eight other Latin American institutions, shows on a [map of](https://mineria.amazoniasocioambiental.org/) more than 2000 points in which illegal activity is occurring throughout the Amazon in South America. From the data, its clear that in 96 protected natural areas there is presence of illegal activity.

From the [interactive map](https://mineria.amazoniasocioambiental.org/), we can see where the illegal mining is taking place. Most of the reported activity is in Venezuela (1899), followed by Brazil (321), Ecuador (68) and then Peru (24).

On this surface this interactive map, as a digital tool seems incredibly useful, but based on my experience its unclear whether these information streamlining tools are actually helping address illegal activities, like mining and logging, in the protected Amazon regions.

Before discussing why, its important to understand the different types of innovative tools currently employed to help address the challenge.

## Use of Remote Sensing for Illegal Activity Identification and Alerts

With the proliferation of satellite imagery services, we have access to high definition images and almost in real-time to monitor change in land use through photographs that have a spatial resolution of up to 30 centimeters.

Experiences from Brazil with the [INPE (National Institute of Spaces Research)](http://www.obt.inpe.br/OBT/assuntos/programas/amazonia/prodes)and in Peru with the [National Program of Forest Conservation for the Mitigation of Climate Change](http://geobosques.minam.gob.pe/geobosque/view/index.php) (within the Ministry of Environment), show that there is use for remote sensing and spatial analysis to identify areas of mining exploitation.

According to conversations I've held with the authorities in Peru, the tool is quite useful. Nevertheless, there is a lack of human capital to intervene in a timely fashion to prevent the illegal activity from continuing. In addition, there are required political procedures that need to be followed, which makes it difficult for authorities to respond quickly.

That said, initiatives such as the [Association for the Conservation of the Amazon Account (ACCA)](http://www.acca.org.pe) with their [Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP)](https://maaproject.org/es/), demonstrates both capacity to analyze the data and respond to illegal activity occurring in protected regions.

## Drones, a Useful Tool for Local Challenges

Drones have revolutionized the use of aerial photographs and maps for civil society. Companies like [Terra-i](http://www.terra-i.org/terra-i.html) have promoted the use of drones to [validate satellite information](https://amazonlandscapes.org/drone-monitoring-of-land-cover-changes-detected-by-terra-i-in-yurimaguas-peru/). For instance, imagery from Landsat 7 satellite only provides an image with resolution of 30 meters, meaning its hard to confirm what is occurring within the image. Drones can capture images at closer distances and can help confirm whether illegal activity is occurring in the area photographed by a satellite.

The most common drone models used for these types of activities are the [Ebee](https://www.sensefly.com/drone/ebee-mapping-drone/) or the [Phantom 4](https://www.dji.pe/producto/phantom-4-pro/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAkMDiBRDNARIsACKP1FFNnhxDKS0LPG-QFSEcTipATuFx4CSg38WpMumQJv-2cjg_Vke0-9IaAo7REALw_wcB). The only downside of these models is that neither can fly for very long distances. The Ebee, for example, can only fly for a radius of 4km. The Phantom 4 can only cover a distance of 25ha. These limitations are due to their battery life. Another drawback for many initiatives looking to deploy drones in their cost.  A Phantom 4 costs around $2,160 and an Ebee costs around $27,000. Purchasing either model, is no small investment. 

That said, the benefit of using drone technology to help validate whether illegal activity is occurring in protected areas of the Amazon is clear. The question is whether investing in a drone will then lead to concrete steps by authorities to prevent future illegal actions, like mining or logging. 

## Web and Mobile Applications to Inform and Report

Mobile and web applications are also critical to helping combat illegal mining or logging throughout the Amazon. For instance, tools such as the [Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART) ](http://smartconservationtools.org/)are used in [Colombia ](https://colombia.wcs.org/es-es/WCS-Colombia/Noticias/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/11116/Entrenamiento-en-la-herramienta-SMART.aspx)to record data from surveillance tours in real-time and  to improve the management of a protected Amazon areas. The SMART toolkit is based on open software and is therefore a great tool to consider using if you're looking for the best way to provide medium to long term support to a project.

In Peru, the Forest Service (SERFOR) encourages people to use a web-based application called "[Alerta SERFOR](http://appweb.serfor.gob.pe/denunciasserfor/)." Alerta SERFOR allows any citizen to report any illegal activity harming wildlife or the Amazon's fauna.

## Using Acoustic Monitoring

Acoustic monitoring devices are another tools used to monitor the presence of species, biological corridors, and to monitor illegal logging. The [Open Acoustic Devices](https://www.openacousticdevices.info) research group developed devices, like the AudioMoth, that  monitor anthropogenic disturbances based on changes in acoustics. Devices like the AudioMoth can be used to help authorities trying to prevent illegal activity in protected natural preserves, identify where the illegal activity took place. Additionally, this type of technology is relatively cheap and on average can be purchased for about $43.

## Technology Alone Can't Solve the Challenge 

So far in this blog, I've reviewed four specific digital tools used to combat illegal logging and mining in the Amazon. Although each hold great promise in helping authorities protect the Amazon, technology alone will not help solve the problem of illegal mining and logging. In addition to the deployment of these tech-based tools, there needs to be political will from South American countries to invest in addressing the issue.  Together with more resources, these tech-based tools can create headway into preventing illegal logging and mining from going unpunished. Therefore, if I were to give advice to an organization, institution, or government looking protect the Amazon, I'd encourage them to focus simultaneously on building sustainable digital tools, while advocating for political support for these initiatives. 

1. **Building for sustainability: **To build digital tools for sustainability, they must be **interoperable**. Interoperability is defined as the capacity of a system or systems that can work with other existing or future systems, without restriction of access or implementation. By standardizing spatial data through the creation of Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), interoperability between digital tools becomes possible. This is actually how the  the interactive RAISG [map](https://mineria.amazoniasocioambiental.org/) operates. It is fed data from multiple [regional SDIs](https://mineria.amazoniasocioambiental.org/sobre/) , and plotting the data on an interactive map for public use. This interoperability offers an **opportunity**, because it demonstrates that data standardization and 

2. **Opportunity**: The management of SDIs and their interaction with other applications and platforms offers an opportunity. We should encourage this, so that new ways of using and consuming geospatial information are created.

3. **Inter-Institutional Articulation**: In Latin American countries, inter-institutional coordination is vital. In addition, sharing knowledge of the products and alerts generated for their own internal use is critical, as well as the articulation between the different institutions that address the problem of illegal logging and mining.

4. **Legal Support**: The advance in legal regulation and legal doctrine is very slow with respect to the use of the information generated by digital tools, these usually are not valid as a source. When dealing with a problem as serious as illegal logging and mining, we must ensure the creation of legal mechanisms that are based on validated digital information so that appropriate punishment can be determined for the crime committed.
