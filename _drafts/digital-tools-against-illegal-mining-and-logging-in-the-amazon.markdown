A recent report prepared by the [Amazonian Geo-referenced Socio-Environmental Information Network (RAISG) ](https://www.amazoniasocioambiental.org/es/)and [InfoAmazonia](https://infoamazonia.org/es/), in coordination with eight other Latin American institutions, shows on a [map of](https://mineria.amazoniasocioambiental.org/) more than 2000 points in which illegal activity is occurring throughout the Amazon in South America. From the data, its clear that in 96 protected natural areas there is presence of illegal activity.

From the [interactive map](https://mineria.amazoniasocioambiental.org/), we can see where the illegal mining is taking place. Most of the reported activity is in Venezuela (1899), followed by Brazil (321), Ecuador (68) and then Peru (24).

On this surface this interactive map, as a digital tool seems incredibly useful, but based on my experience its unclear whether these information streamlining tools are actually helping address illegal activities, like mining and logging, in the protected Amazon regions. 

Before discussing why, its important to understand the different types of innovative tools currently employed to help address the challenge. 

## Use of Remote Sensing for Illegal Activity Identification and Alerts

With the proliferation of satellite imagery services, we have access to high definition images and almost in real-time to monitor change in land use through photographs that have a spatial resolution of up to 30 centimeters.

Experiences from Brazil with the [INPE (National Institute of Spaces Research)](http://www.obt.inpe.br/OBT/assuntos/programas/amazonia/prodes)and in Peru with the [National Program of Forest Conservation for the Mitigation of Climate Change](http://geobosques.minam.gob.pe/geobosque/view/index.php) (within the Ministry of Environment), show that there is use for remote sensing and spatial analysis to identify areas of mining exploitation.

According to conversations I've held with the authorities in Peru, the tool is quite useful. Nevertheless, there is a lack of human capital to intervene in a timely fashion to prevent the illegal activity from continuing. In addition, there are required political procedures that need to be followed, which makes it difficult for authorities to respond quickly. 

That said, initiatives such as the [Association for the Conservation of the Amazon Account (ACCA)](http://www.acca.org.pe) with their [Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP)](https://maaproject.org/es/), demonstrates both capacity to analyze the data and respond to illegal activity occurring in protected regions. 

## Drones, a Useful Tool for Local Challenges

Drones have revolutionized the use of aerial photographs and maps for civil society. Companies like [Terra-i](http://www.terra-i.org/terra-i.html) have promoted the use of drones to [validate satellite information](https://amazonlandscapes.org/drone-monitoring-of-land-cover-changes-detected-by-terra-i-in-yurimaguas-peru/). For instance, imagery from Landsat 7 satellite only provides an image with resolution of 30 meters, meaning its hard to confirm what is occurring within the image. Drones can capture images at closer distances and can help confirm whether illegal activity is occurring in the area photographed by a satellite. This validation process then helps 

Drones like the [Ebee](https://www.sensefly.com/drone/ebee-mapping-drone/) or the [Phantom 4](https://www.dji.pe/producto/phantom-4-pro/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAkMDiBRDNARIsACKP1FFNnhxDKS0LPG-QFSEcTipATuFx4CSg38WpMumQJv-2cjg_Vke0-9IaAo7REALw_wcB) are the most common models used for these validation activities. Yet a major challenge is the distance that these drones can fly. The Ebee can fly a radius of up to 4km and the Phantom can cover up to 25ha. These distance limitations are due to battery life with each lasting between 20-30 minutes depending on the model.  Cost is another factor to consider. A Phantom 4 is around 2,160 USD and the Ebee costs around 27,000 USD.

It is clear that drones can be useful to detect illegal activity. Yet, due to cost and limited battery life their use is will be more effective if applied locally and as a secondary option to identifying illegal activity.

## Web and Mobile Applications to Inform and Report

Mobile and web applications are also critical to helping combat illegal activity in the Amazon. Tools such as [Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART) ](http://smartconservationtools.org/)are used in [Colombia ](https://colombia.wcs.org/es-es/WCS-Colombia/Noticias/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/11116/Entrenamiento-en-la-herramienta-SMART.aspx)to record data from surveillance tours in real time and exchange information to improve the management of a protected areas. This set of tools (SMART) has an open software approach,leveraging a development community around the world. Therefore its a great tool to consider for anyone looking to provide medium to long term support to a project looking to help address these challenges.

In Peru, the Forest Service (SERFOR) promotes a web application called “[Alerta SERFOR](http://appweb.serfor.gob.pe/denunciasserfor/)”, used to make forest or wildlife complaints. The application that can be used by any citizen.

## Using Acoustic Monitoring

Acoustic monitoring devices have been used to monitor the presence of species, biological corridors, and to monitor illegal logging. The [Open Acoustic Devices](https://www.openacousticdevices.info) research group has developed devices such as the AudioMoth that attempts to acoustically monitor anthropogenic disturbances. These devices are not incredibly expensive and on average sell at a price around 43 USD each. This type of innovative technology can help people looking to combat illegal logging at a lower cost than some other tech-based approaches.

## Social Challenges and Opportunities Facing Technological Advances

So far in this blog, I've reviewed four specific uses of digital tools to combat illegal logging and mining in the Amazon, but finding tech solutions is never the end of the conversation. Rather, for the tools to be truly effective in combating illegal mining or logging, it is important that these countries also address other societal challenges that will allow these efforts to be more efficient. To me, there are four major areas:

1. **Interoperability:** Interoperability is defined as the capacity of a System or systems whose interfaces are available, to work with other existing or future products or systems and without restriction of access or implementation. By means of the creation of the SDI (Spatial Data Infrastructure) it is possible to have the standardized data for the consumption of other platforms, in fact the interactive RAISG [map](https://mineria.amazoniasocioambiental.org/) I mentioned works because it is fed by the [Regional SDIs ](https://mineria.amazoniasocioambiental.org/sobre/)in different countries.

2. **Opportunity**: The management of SDIs and their interaction with other applications and platforms offers an opportunity. We should encourage this, so that new ways of using and consuming geospatial information are created.

3. **Inter-Institutional Articulation**: In Latin American countries, inter-institutional coordination is vital. In addition, sharing knowledge of the products and alerts generated for their own internal use is critical, as well as the articulation between the different institutions that address the problem of illegal logging and mining.

4. **Legal Support**: The advance in legal regulation and legal doctrine is very slow with respect to the use of the information generated by digital tools, these usually are not valid as a source. When dealing with a problem as serious as illegal logging and mining, we must ensure the creation of legal mechanisms that are based on validated digital information so that appropriate punishment can be determined for the crime committed.
