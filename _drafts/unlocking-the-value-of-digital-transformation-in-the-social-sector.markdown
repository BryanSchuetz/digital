For many years, the support of international donors to civil society organizations, private and public sectors in the technology field revolved around the provision of equipment, hardware, and software. On many occasions, these types of support have proved ineffective. Or as [researchers](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261263057_Overcoming_ICT_project_failures_-_A_practical_perspective) wrote in 2013, these investments quickly became obsolete or abandoned. 

The accelerated technological evolution in the areas of communication and collaboration has generated a change in society, specifically in the “digital use”, allowing people to interact globally through platforms, giving space to a process of digitalization of the traditional work model being more efficient.

Thus, in the last decade, the offer of software as a service (SaaS) and tools “cloudization” (the use of cloud services) have pushed organizations to naturally integrate their use, digitizing processes, but not transforming their models, it is no coincidence that CISCO in 2017 worked with more than 18 local governments in India in its digital transformation (Digital Effects, 2017), redefining the connectivity model in cities through Wifi cloudization, supporting the change to have access to a new business model around connectivity devices.

The paradigm has changed, the impact of the investments in governments and social organizations is not on the provision of expensive software solutions or server clusters for data processing and storage – perhaps, not as a first step – the value lies in demonstrating a correct and responsible digital use that transforms traditional models into more efficient and effective ones for organizations and their beneficiaries.

In recent experiences in El Salvador through the USAID Project for the Strengthening of Local Organizations, found three characteristics that enhance the value of Digital Transformation:

1. **Leadership**: For Shaaban (2019), leadership is “the art of inducing compliance, as an exercise in influence… using it as an instrument in achieving objectives, as an effect of interaction, as a differentiated role and as the beginning of the structure, without leadership, the fundamental block of the transformation fails to demonstrate the value of the change ”. Leadership will become a *sinecuanum* condition for investment in digital transformation processes in countries in emerging markets. In other words, having clear leadership is the first and the most fundamental step.

2. **Learning by doing**: In 2015, Bessen in his book Learning by Doing ensures that a good number of studies in developing nations have shown that the adoption of new technologies is more effective when there are learning processes involved, recently in a workshop with the Civil Society Organizations of El Salvador found the organizations went from having a broad skepticism about the application of agile techniques in Project Management to a total interest on the use of frameworks such as Scrum and Kanban applied to their projects with tools in the cloud. This has given us the opportunity to discover the need to support the methodology for formulating digital strategies of the organizations necessary to achieve the objectives of the organization successfully.

3. **Skills**: Understanding the emotions of others (empathy); the ability to solve unpublished problems (lateral thinking); the generation of new ideas (creativity); the ability to complement each other with different people (the alliance); and the talent of unforeseeable solving a circumstance (critical thinking) are valuable organization’s assets, with which we have worked for since in them lies the empowerment and openness to think outside the box and see the value that it brings its transformation

Finding the value resulting from the relationship between automation and data analysis, for the generation of business models, surpasses any digitalization project that is only technologically applied. It is essential to look at the strategy that leads social organizations to initiate a transformation so as to remain relevant.
