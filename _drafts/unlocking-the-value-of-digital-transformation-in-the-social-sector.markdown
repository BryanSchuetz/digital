For many years, the support of international donors to civil society organizations, private and public sectors in the technology field revolved around the provision of equipment, hardware, and software. On many occasions, these types of support have proved ineffective. Or as [researchers](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261263057_Overcoming_ICT_project_failures_-_A_practical_perspective) wrote in 2013, these investments quickly became obsolete or abandoned. Since then, we in the digital development community have supported international donors and international programming to better integrate technology into development projects.

In the near decade since the publishing of the 2013 paper aforementioned, the accelerated digital revolution has reshaped societies, changing the ways in which people interact and work.  Software as a service (SaaS) and the use of tools like cloud services ( referred to as“cloudization”) are great examples. As organizations have adopted them, they've digitized processes. At the same time, few of these same organizations have then transformed their business models. In other words, the majority of digitization work, has focused primarily on installing these software and tools, rather than behavior change to ensure adoption across an organization.

A clear example is CISCO's work in 2017, worked with 14 local governments in India in their digital transformation  by upgrading their connectivity models in cities through Wifi cloudization. As a result, this increased access to new business models based on increased connectivity. Although digital infrastructure remains a very important issue for securing access, the digital paradigm has changed.

The impact of digital transformation comes less from the procurement of expensive software solutions or  server clusters. Instead, the value lies in helping organizations to adopt responsible digital use that transforms traditional business models who's benefits extend beyond increased efficiency.

Recently, in my work with the the USAID Project for the Strengthening of Local Organizations, I found three characteristics that enhance the value of Digital Transformation:

1. **Leadership**: For Shaaban (2019), leadership is “the art of inducing compliance, as an exercise in influence… using it as an instrument in achieving objectives, as an effect of interaction, as a differentiated role and as the beginning of the structure, without leadership, the fundamental block of the transformation fails to demonstrate the value of the change ”. Leadership will become a *sinecuanum* condition for investment in digital transformation processes in countries in emerging markets. In other words, having clear leadership is the first and the most fundamental step.

2. **Learning by doing**: In 2015, Bessen in his book Learning by Doing ensures that a good number of studies in developing nations have shown that the adoption of new technologies is more effective when there are learning processes involved, recently in a workshop with the Civil Society Organizations of El Salvador found the organizations went from having a broad skepticism about the application of agile techniques in Project Management to a total interest on the use of frameworks such as Scrum and Kanban applied to their projects with tools in the cloud. This has given us the opportunity to discover the need to support the methodology for formulating digital strategies of the organizations necessary to achieve the objectives of the organization successfully.

3. **Skills**: Understanding the emotions of others (empathy); the ability to solve unpublished problems (lateral thinking); the generation of new ideas (creativity); the ability to complement each other with different people (the alliance); and the talent of unforeseeable solving a circumstance (critical thinking) are valuable organization’s assets, with which we have worked for since in them lies the empowerment and openness to think outside the box and see the value that it brings its transformation

Finding the value resulting from the relationship between automation and data analysis, for the generation of business models, surpasses any digitalization project that is only technologically applied. It is essential to look at the strategy that leads social organizations to initiate a transformation so as to remain relevant.
