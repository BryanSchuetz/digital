Kicking off in 2019, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) Prosperity Fund Mexico Financial Services Program aims to create a more inclusive and competitive financial services sector accessible to all segments of Mexican society and market entrants. Despite challenges due to COVID-19, this program has been able to hit the ground running, creating Caravana FinTech, an initiative that seeks to increase adoption and awareness of financial technology (FinTech) solutions that benefit Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). I was able to have a conversation (virtually) with Roberto Velez, FinTech Adoption and Socialization Lead, and Lorena Segura, FinTech Socialization Leader, where we discussed how the program is supporting MSMEs to expand their reach and encourage the use of Fintech solutions. ![logo_caravana_fintech.png](/uploads/logo_caravana_fintech.png)
