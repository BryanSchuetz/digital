Kicking off in 2019, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) Prosperity Fund Mexico Financial Services Program aims to create a more inclusive and competitive financial services sector accessible to all segments of Mexican society and market entrants. Despite challenges due to COVID-19, this program has been able to hit the ground running, creating Caravana FinTech, an initiative that seeks to increase adoption and awareness of financial technology (FinTech) solutions that benefit Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). I was able to have a conversation (virtually) with Roberto Velez, FinTech Adoption and Socialization Lead, and Lorena Segura, FinTech Socialization Leader, where we discussed how the program is supporting MSMEs to expand their reach and encourage the use of Fintech solutions. ![logo_caravana_fintech.png](/uploads/logo_caravana_fintech.png)

**Can you give me some background on Caravana Fintech and its objectives?**

The first thing that’s important to understand is that we have an opportunity here. [89 percent of the population in Mexico has a smartphone](https://www.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/saladeprensa/aproposito/2020/EAP_Internet20.pdf). However, [only 37 percent have a bank account](https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/). This is a big gap that can and should be addressed by FinTech solutions. Therefore, Caravana FinTech implements activities to communicate and promote the use of FinTech solutions in at least six states across Mexico, (we hope to have national coverage by the end of the project). These activities are carried out in conjunction with public and private sector partners and work to share FinTech's basic concepts, explain products and services, and demonstrate how these concepts are translated into practice. The ultimate goal is to accelerate adoption and general knowledge of FinTech solutions to close that gap. To do so, we go state to state to better understand the local context, including the financial services needs of their MSMEs, and then work to map those needs with appropriate FinTech solutions. We then can put out an open call for FinTechs to design solutions to address the identified needs. We also generally want to grow the population’s knowledge of FinTech solutions through socialization activities. Through webinars, workshops (now virtually) and other communications strategies, we want our target audience to better understand how FinTech solutions work and can benefit them.
