As discussed in [part one of this series](https://dai-global-digital.com/what-is-agile-part-one-the-story-behind-the-buzzword.html), agile is an umbrella term which encapsulates a number of frameworks, strategies, and tools. In this second post of the series, we dive a bit deeper into what agile is in practice by highlighting some of the most common frameworks being used by agile teams. This primer on agile frameworks and methods will by no means be comprehensive (there are entire courses, website, and certifications dedicated to each of them), but it can serve as a good starting point for better understanding which flavor of agile might be best suited to your teams’ needs if you are considering adopting agile in your organization. This post will cover two of the most popular types of agile in more depth: Scrum and Kanban. There are [several others](https://www.wrike.com/project-management-guide/faq/what-are-the-different-types-of-agile-methodologies/) that are widely used as well, but these two have many components that can be flexible and adaptable for use in non-software development contexts.

[Scrum](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/scrum/) is one of the most popular and widely used frameworks in agile and is centered around using a set of specific processes to achieve the team’s goals. The key components of Scrum can be broken up into three categories:

1. Events or time boxes;

2. Artifacts; and

3. Roles.

One of the defining aspects of using Scrum is dividing up work in a time box called a ‘**sprint**’. Sprints are typically one month or less and are meant to allow teams to break up their work into chunks that are still shippable (or ready to be deployed for users) without necessarily needing to complete every piece of functionality. Several meetings are essential parts of Scrum that ensure the team is working actively towards their goals for each sprint, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Reviews, and Sprint Retrospectives.

Artifacts in Scrum are the different objects or items that are needed to guide the team’s processes. One of the essential artifacts is the **product backlog** – where a team keeps all the possible items they might want to work on. The backlog is at its core an organized list of every option the team has available in terms of work that could be done, but it is not a commitment to get to every item. For each sprint, the team draws items from the backlog to determine the exact work they will do in that particular timebox.

There are three key roles in Scrum: [Scrum Master](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/scrum-master), [Product Owner](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/product-owner/), and [Team](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/team/). The **Scrum Master** is considered the keeper of the process. They are there to help make sure the team lives agile values and is following the process they agreed to as part of Scrum. They help remove obstacles preventing the team from moving forward and they organize the critical meetings outlined above. The **Product Owner** is considered the keeper of the requirements and is the final say on what is a priority in the product backlog. This role was designed to help the Team better understand the direction and remove any opportunity for conflicting guidance on the end goals. The **Team**, in the agile and Scrum context, refers to the group responsible for implementing the work and who have a shared responsibility for the goals of the project. In Scrum, it is also important to note that the Team is considered “self-organizing” – meaning that they decide how to break down the work and decide how it is assigned amongst the group. There is no ‘lead’ who doles out work or makes unilateral decisions.

## Kanban

[Kanban](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/kanban/#q=\~(infinite\~false\~filters\~(postType\~(\~'page\~'post\~'aa_book\~'aa_event_session\~'aa_experience_report\~'aa_glossary\~'aa_research_paper\~'aa_video)\~tags\~(\~'kanban))\~searchTerm\~'\~sort\~false\~sortDirection\~'asc\~page\~1)) is another very popular agile methodology with a primary focus on the flow and visualization of work being done. In contrast to Scrum, it is comprised of a series of practices as opposed to specific core components:

1. **Visualize;**

2. **Limit Work in Progress;**

3. **Manage Flow**

4. **Make Policies Explicit;**

5. **Implement Feedback Loops; and**

6. **Improve collaboratively, evolve experimentally.**
