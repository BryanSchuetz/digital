Ah, the [dog days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_days) of summer. Usually a slow time for work, that means there's extra time to sit at your computer looking for good stuff to read, struggling with either being uncomfortably warm from the summer heat or excruciatingly cold from over-aggressive office air-conditioning. We get it. Fresh ICT4D reads from our August Round Up below! 

1. [African Economy: The Limit of Leapfrogging](https://www.ft.com/content/052b0a34-9b1b-11e8-9702-5946bae86e6d?sharetype=blocked): This is just a really excellent piece that digs into the realities of the leapfrog phenomenon in the African context, taking examples from ICt4Ag and mHealth to reality check the technology "solutionism" for the African context. Super engaging, definitely worth your read.

2. ECCN, USAID and INEE's [Checklist for Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) Interventions to Support Education in Crisis and Conflict Settings](https://eccnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/ICT-Interventions-Checklist.pdf): I'm always a big fan of usable, pragmatic tools that make implementing digital services easier and better. This is one of them.
