In the typical way things happen at large global firms with highly decentralized project management, I first learned about the exceptional digital work being done by DAIâ€™s USAID-funded [Agricultural Value Chain Activity in Uzbekistan project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/uzbekistan-usaid-agricultural-value-chain-activity-uzbekistan-uzbekistan-avc) (AVC) via a printed out email referenced in a meeting about something totally different.  I took a photo of the email - true story, I even sent the shot to my colleagues I was so excited - followed up with the listed contacts, and two weeks later was  having a fascinating conversation with two dynamic Uzbek colleagues who run the project's digital initiatives as they told me all about the initiatives I detail below.

## The unexpected folks watching Uzbek YouTube horticultural training videos

As their first foray into digital tools,  AVC launched a YouTube channel last year with short training videos to teach farmers best practices around pruning and disease control. They advertise the channel on partners' Facebook pages and mine the comments for questions that will help them better tailor and target seasonal content. In addition, AVC tracks all views data - learning, for example, that viewers don't watch more than 2 minutes of content. The project YouTube page currently has 52,000 views since May of last year, with a rapidly growing subscriber base among both Uzbeks and the neighboring countries - 40% of viewers come from Russia, and 18% from Kazakhstan. The diaspora and export market viewership audience is strong. Given the crop similarities in the regional countries as well as large diaspora populations, these audience numbers are not surprising.

## ICT: from social to the workplace

AVC works nationwide across Uzbekistan - no easy task in a country with challenging terrain and poor internal transportation infrastructure, especially in a project heavily focused on training.  Messaging apps made their appearance in Uzbekistan about four years ago, with Telegram leading the pack as the most popular app in [Commonwealth of Independent State countries](http://www.cisstat.com/eng/cis.htm). Uzbeks like Telegram because it's fast, doesn't use a ton of data, doesn't take up a lot of phone memory and works well on low bandwidth data - plus, it has stickers (you can see our full review of Telegram from Appathon 2016 [here](https://dai-global-digital.com/app-a-thon-2016-telegram-for-development.html)).  Because the staff and partners of AVC used Telegram so much in their personal lives, it was a natural migration point to pivot to workplace conversations.

Three months ago, AVC set up a chat group with its regional program partners so it would be easier to consult and train remotely and allow the project to better and more consistently serve remote partners whom it otherwise took a week of travel just to reach. Originally launched with 30 people, much to AVC's surprise the group was a huge hit - AVC's partners added their partners, their friends added friends, and it took off.  Beyond just meeting real-time training needs of the partners through chat and media, the group allowed the partners to feel more connected to the program and for the members to build both personal and professional bonds.  The chat group also took on a life of its own beyond the original vision of the project, becoming a self-directed marketplace for buyers and sellers after one member posted about buying cherries. As the group has evolved into an organic forum for members to do business together, deals are struck in regional areas across the country and business relationships are formed that will last far beyond the five year span of the project.  The group now has 200 carefully curated members of leading Uzbek horticulturalists and is a busy information channel with 30-40 messages daily and a constant flow of questions, photos, videos and dialogue.

## Cross-channel data mining

AVC's best in class digital channel work doesn't stop at just content - AVC actively seeks to cross-leverage channels to understand their end user needs better. For example, they share all their YouTube videos in the Telegram group, to get reactions and learn real needs from a highly targeted and pioneering audience.  The two currently active project channels - YouTube and the Telegram chat group - are related but not fully cross-referencing.  AVC doesn't advertise their Telegram group in the YouTube channel but as the small size of the group keeps it useful and focused for members; it also allows AVC to use the group to figure out a content strategy and identify data patterns to figure out what time of year certain content is needed.  

## Building on accidental success

Cognizant of the demand for a wider Telegram presence, AVC seems their unexpectedly wildly-successful chat group as a perfect small-scale pilot to figure out their strategy to open up a Telegram channel - a publicly available content stream on the Telegram app. AVC is currently planning to launch this channel next year, after a full year of running the private chat group - enough time to put together a strong editorial calendar based on the patterns they see in the group and in the reactions to their YouTube content. We will definitely be checking back in with them as that channel is launched!
