In the typical way things happen at large global firms with highly decentralized project management, I first learned about the exceptional digital work being done by DAIâ€™s USAID-funded [Agricultural Value Chain Activity in Uzbekistan project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/uzbekistan-usaid-agricultural-value-chain-activity-uzbekistan-uzbekistan-avc) (AVC) via a printed out email referenced in a meeting about something totally different.  I took a photo of the email - true story, I even sent the shot to my colleagues I was so excited - followed up with the listed contacts, and two weeks later was  having a fascinating conversation with two dynamic Uzbek colleagues who run the project's digital initiatives.

## ICT: from social to the workplace

AVC works nationwide across Uzbekistan - no easy task in a country with challenging terrain and poor internal transportation infrastructure, especially in a project heavily focused on training.  Messaging apps made their appearance in Uzbekistan about four years ago, with Telegram leading the pack as the most popular app in [Commonwealth of Independent State countries](http://www.cisstat.com/eng/cis.htm). Uzbeks like Telegram because it's fast, doesn't use a ton of data, doesn't take up a lot of phone memory and works well on low bandwidth data - plus, it has stickers (you can see our full review of Telegram from Appathon 2016 [here](https://dai-global-digital.com/app-a-thon-2016-telegram-for-development.html)).  Because the staff and partners of AVC used Telegram so much in their personal lives, it was a natural migration point to pivot to workplace conversations.

Three months ago, AVC set up a chat group with its regional program partners so it would be easier to consult and train remotely and allow the project to better and more consistently serve remote partners whom it otherwise took a week of travel just to reach. Originally launched with 30 people, much to AVC's surprise the group was a huge hit - AVC's partners added their partners, their friends added friends, and it took off.  Beyond just meeting real-time training needs of the partners through chat and media, the group allowed the partners to feel more connected to the program and for the members to build both personal and professional bonds.  The chat group also took on a life of its own beyond the original vision of the project, becoming a self-directed marketplace for buyers and sellers after one member posted about buying cherries. As the group has evolved into an organic forum for members to do business together, deals are struck in regional areas across the country and business relationships are formed.  The group now has 200 carefully curated members of leading Uzbek horticulturalists and is becoming a busy channel is 30-40 messages daily and a constant flow of questions, photos, videos and dialogue.
