Over the last 15 years, the global proliferation of mobile phones has been revolutionary. It is estimated that there are currently more than 7.2 billion mobile phone connections globally.  As more and more people across the world gain access to cellphones, the potential for leveraging the device to tackle global health challenges has skyrocketed. Thus the field of mobile health (mHealth) emerged in the mid-2000s. Unfortunately, more than a decade later, this potential has yet to be fully realized. If one were to ask a global health expert if there has been one mHealth program, with proven results, that has transformed healthcare in a country or region, there would not be much of a response. The issue to date is not in the quantity of mHealth initiatives; innovators around the world are creating app after app that focus on a variety of health issues. Rather, the problem is that many of them remain in the pilot or informational stage, used only to target subsets of the population or in a given donor-funded program. Additionally, the most commonly reported mHealth initiatives aim to affect behavior change and data gathering, rather than systems level change. As a result, the majority of mHealth initiatives lack the capacity to grow and scale large enough to make a measurable impact on health outcomes. 

One of the main inhibitors to scale in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is the lack of evidence to prove that certain mHealth initiatives are more effective than others. A [meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4216389/) of 76 studies on mHealth interventions found the following three issues with evidence:

* While growing, the quantity and quality of evidence that proves the efficacy of mHealth interventions in LMICs is still limited;
* The evidence that does exist is of pilot studies and small scale interventions in which the results are not necessary applicable at scale; and  
* ![mhealth-af95ba.jpg](/uploads/mhealth-af95ba.jpg)Much of this evidence is anecdotal and difficult to interpret.

Given these issues, it is no wonder that healthcare providers in LMICs are finding it difficult to choose which mHealth initiatives will be impactful and cost-effective for widespread use. 

This problem is especially apparent in Kenya. Often called the “Silicon Savannah,” Kenya has been the epicenter of technology innovation in sub-Saharan Africa. By 2015, 82 percent of the Kenyan adult population already owned a mobile phone.  The success of M-Pesa mobilized a culture of innovation that resulted in several mHealth efforts, both local and international, targeting the Kenyan population. While this should serve as an opportunity to improve healthcare nationally, the reality is that the ecosystem that enables mHealth innovations to go to market and scale is still lacking. A [GSMA report](https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/programme/ecosystem-accelerator/digital-entrepreneurship-in-kenya-2014-2) similarly concluded that in Kenya “40 percent of mobile startups receive less than $1,200 of funding, and 93 percent have received less than $120,000.” As funding is directly tied to the capacity to scale, mHealth innovators face a constant struggle and perverse incentives when trying to grow their initiatives. Why try to scale an initiative that pilots well, when there is more and easier funding for launching a new app altogether? 

There is no doubt that mobile phones can be used as a tool in combating health challenges that have plagued LMICs for decades, but, as we examine the potential of mHealth, now is the time to focus less on innovation, and more on achieving impact through scaling what works.
