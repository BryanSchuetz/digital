Last month, [Chloe Messenger](http://dai-global-digital.com/authors/chloe-messenger/) posted the first [blog](http://dai-global-digital.com/digital-development-in-the-western-balkans-bosnia-and-herzegovina.html) on Bosnia and Herzegovina in our six-part series about digital development in the Western Balkans.

Next up – Kosovo!
