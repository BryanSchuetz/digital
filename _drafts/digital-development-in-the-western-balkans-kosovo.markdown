Last month, the talented, globe-trotting [Chloe Messenger](http://dai-global-digital.com/authors/chloe-messenger/) posted the first [blog](http://dai-global-digital.com/digital-development-in-the-western-balkans-bosnia-and-herzegovina.html) on DAI’s activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina in our six-part series about digital development in the Western Balkans. If you haven’t read it, you should. If you did, you’ll know that DAI has partnered with the United Kingdom’s Foreign Commonwealth Office (FCO) to map digital ecosystems across the Western Balkans, with a focus on developing innovative partnerships to close the digital skill supply-demand gap.

Bosnia and Herzegovina, check. Next up – Kosovo!

Let me start by giving you some background. Since the end of the Kosovo War in 1999 and its independence from Serbia almost a decade later, Kosovo has been working to rebuild socially, politically, and economically. Its efforts have been hugely successful: over the past decade, the country has become the fastest-growing economy in the Western Balkans. And the digital economy – the economic activity that results from myriad online business transactions and connections through internet-based markets - is a major contributor to this upward trend.

The technology sector in Kosovo is thriving despite many roadblocks. The low cost of building digital products and services has enabled Kosovars to rapidly grow the sector, spurring job generation, improving the export market, and increasing incomes. Rapid growth has also been enabled by the following:

• 70 percent of the population is under 35 years of age and interested in new and innovative employment opportunities, such as the digital sector.
• There is more than 85 percent internet penetration and 90 percent 3G and 4G coverage across the country.
• Kosovo is ranked 44 out of 190 economies on the Ease of Doing Business Index due to its business-friendly regulatory environment, especially for the technology sector
• The Kosovo government stated that digital is one of the six priority sectors for economic development 

These building blocks have enabled rapid growth, but key barriers persist.
