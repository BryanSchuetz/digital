Last month, [Chloe Messenger](http://dai-global-digital.com/authors/chloe-messenger/) posted the first [blog](http://dai-global-digital.com/digital-development-in-the-western-balkans-bosnia-and-herzegovina.html) on Bosnia and Herzegovina in our six-part series about digital development in the Western Balkans. As mentioned, the United Kingdom’s Foreign Commonwealth Office (FCO) funded DAI to map digital ecosystems across the Western Balkans, and to identify areas where the FCO can support the technology sector in closing the digital skill supply-demand gap.

Next up – Kosovo!

Kosovo has been working to rebuild socially, politically, and economically since the end of the Kosovo War in 1999 and its independence from Serbia in 2008. Over the past decade, the country has become the fastest-growing economy in the Western Balkans and the digital economy is a major contributor to this upward trend.

Despite several challenges, which I will describe below, the technology sector in Kosovo is thriving. The low input cost of building digital products and services has enabled Kosovars to rapidly grow the sector, generating jobs, improving the export market, and increasing incomes. Further building blocks include:
• 70 percent of the population is under 35 years of age and interested in new and innovative employment opportunities, such as the digital sector.
• There is more than 85 percent internet penetration and 90 percent 3G and 4G coverage across the country.
• Kosovo is ranked 44 out of 190 economies on the Ease of Doing Business Index due to its business-friendly regulatory environment, especially for the technology sector
• The Kosovo government stated that digital is one of the six priority sectors for economic development 

These building blocks have enabled rapid growth, but key barriers persist.
