Think back to the last time you used a mobile app(lication) with annoying menu placement, indecipherable icons and unwieldy user-configurable options. These may seem like minor nuisances in the everyday life of mobile app users, and frankly, most of us probably never notice (or maybe don’t realize that we notice) or hardly care. But user experience in application design is critical to ease of use, efficiency, and staying power of businesses that rely on mobile access and readiness.

I think fast, I click fast, and I want my app to move fast too. I want to go where I want to go as fast as possible, and I don’t want to have to work too hard to find what I’m looking for. Too often I find that icons don’t make sense (to me) or are placed in a location on the screen that is not necessarily intuitive. [UXdesign.cc](https://uxdesign.cc/) has wonderful articles about user experience (UX)/user interface (UI) design that are worth reading over if you are curious about some case studies in UI design (here's one of my [favorites](https://uxdesign.cc/fitbit-a-usability-case-study-b23e4c539c3c)). Aside from personal experience and intuition of the designer, it is important to incorporate research into the design process, particularly research into the psychology of human interactions with technology.

## Researching the human-technology interaction

Humans vary vastly ­-even though our DNA doesn’t- and are usually unoriginal. What I expect from an app can be world's apart from what most people want from an app. Research allows designers to hone in on aspects of the human-technology interaction that neither designers nor users ever expected, thus allowing a design to target specific aspects of the user’s attention, tailored to what the app has to offer.

This isn’t the platform to dive deep into each psychological or perceptual mechanism that UI can address, but check out the list of high-level considerations below, borrowed from a [well-written article](http://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/archive.php?id=126) about psychology and UX:

## 10 Things to About Human Psychology That Should Inform UX Design:

 1. People Don't Want to Work or Think More Than They Have To

 2. People Have Limitations

 3. People Make Mistakes

 4. Human Memory is Complicated

 5. People are Social

 6. People are Easily Distracted

 7. People Crave Information

 8. Most Mental Processing is Unconscious

 9. People Create Mental Models

10. People Understand Visual Systems

## Human-Centered Design for Apps is Still Lacking

Considering users in the design process has definitely increased in the design discipline, but personally, the more I use mobile apps, the less I want to use mobile technology at all. I am human, where is the human centered design for apps?

This is largely reactionary and comes from my own previous experiences and reflections, but my impression is that app designers tend to build products that satisfy their view of the market segment they are engaging in. Some of the best apps spend the extra time getting into the details: XYZ's focus on ABC. These companies are more often than not beyond start-up stage. User research often takes a significant amount of money and time - assets startups don't usually have.

## The Insider Perspective

To be fair, I would venture to say that all app designers think about the usability of their apps, but few achieve ideal and smooth operation. Enter graphic designers and UI experts. I can build web applications all day long, but once you are on the inside of project, it can be difficult to isolate your intimate knowledge of a platform from the idea that a first-time user may have no idea what they are looking at. The need for this exercise in humility and human-centered design cannot be understated. Get a friend, colleague, graphic designer, or better yet, a front-end UI guru to check your stuff out. I bet they will catch many, many things you never thought of. Don’t overwhelm the user and keep it simple.

It feels odd that I can build user-facing applications, but am likely the biggest luddite of the team. I know what I like, and often what I like seems to make sense in terms of application interaction. If we as designers and programmers can remove ourselves from the internal plumbing of applications and come face to face with the user-facing, we just may be able to create more inclusive and useful applications. Thankfully an ever-increasing number of designers are focused on this. Not all achieve perfect UI (is that possible?) but we are on the right track. Unfortunately, I come across apps with lacking UI more often than I think I should.

Part two of this series will have a few examples of my (very subjective) opinion on well-designed apps and those that I often - or always- get hung up using. Stay tuned!
