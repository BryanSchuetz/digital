Welcome to GeekFest 2017, a series of interviews featuring ICT4D thought leaders. Our goals for #geekfest2017 are: to highlight the people and organizations who are pushing the field in new directions, to feature their work and show how it’s different or new, and to support the overall growth of the ICT4D community.

This week we are focusing on public access as a solution to closing the Digital Divide. Being able to access free public Wi-Fi can be crucial for those who cannot afford internet subscriptions: it can mean the difference between finally finding that job, getting the training you need or linking up with a valuable investor for your new venture. The [2017 A4AI  Affordability Report](http://a4ai.org/affordability-report/report/2017/) noted the importance of public Wi-Fi for engendering use of the internet: researched showed public Wi-Fi as one of the most popular options for online access.

We hear from Duduzile Mkhwanazi, CEO of [Project Isizwe](http://www.projectisizwe.org/)-  an organisation making great strides in providing free public WiFi in South Africa, a country where inequality is rife and the affordability of mobile data is just out of reach for many, despite [99% 3G coverage](http://www.mobileconnectivityindex.com/#year=2016&zoneIsocode=ZAF).

**What is Project Isizwe?**
[Project Isizwe](http://www.mobileconnectivityindex.com/#year=2016&zoneIsocode=ZAF) (Xhosa/Zulu translation for ‘nation’, ‘tribe’, ‘people’) is an award winning non-profit organization which aims to bring sustainable internet access to the people across South Africa, by facilitating the rollout of Free Wi-Fi for public spaces in low-income communities. We work closely with both public and private sector in deploying high-quality, free Wi-Fi networks at the lowest possible cost.
We believe that the best way of addressing the social, economic and digital inequality is the deployment of Wi-Fi hotspots throughout public spaces in low-income communities. Internet access is key to bridging the digital divide and free Wi-Fi can go a long way in providing sustainable access is a country where 35 million have either no access or cannot afford access to the internet: that’s 2 out of every 3 people!  We believe that each citizen of Africa should be within a walking distance of free Wi-Fi.

**Why is access so important?**
Let someone take away your smart phone and you fall off the grid for a month or two. How will that impact your personal economy and social inclusion? The world has changed in the advent of the smart phone. If you are not connected now you are trapped in poverty.

**How do you see your projects having a positive economic impact?**
Providing free Wi-Fi is crucial for those who cannot afford regular internet access, giving them the opportunity to participate in society and improve their economic situation. We have amazing feedback from users relating to how our free Wi-Fi got them a job or helped them gain a qualification.  Overall, the positive impact of Free Wi-Fi is way beyond what we imagined. A recent impact study of TshWi-Fi (our initiative in the City of Tshwane) showed that only 28% of TshWi-Fi users are employed. Crucially, 73% of users said they have used TshWi-Fi to look for a job, and 76% have used TshWi-Fi to improve their employability through skills development, showing that free access to the internet is a valuable resource for job-seekers and entrepreneurs. For many, such as those living in temporary accommodation or who are only able to borrow mobiles from friends and relatives, free Wi-Fi is not just temporary, but forms a longer term solution.

Project Isizwe doesn’t just offer free Wi-Fi but also has several value-added services to further the impact of connectivity and promote local content development. For instance, we have signed an MoU with a school in Durban that is curating learning content for upload on the zero-rated portal. Learners across our network are able to download and use the “Online Peer2Peer Edu videos” for free to supplement their studies and improve skills.

**How can you ensure sustainability of the Project?**
Our challenge is to show that free Wi-Fi can be financially self-sustaining. If we can prove that our model works, then project funders can be assured of ongoing impact and success. We are getting positive financial results around using Wi-Fi advertising, the content portal, a micro jobbing database subscription and rental from co-hosting hot spots with LTE providers. Policymakers should stand up and notice the strides Free Public Wi-Fi has taken towards achieving the [SDGs](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/infrastructure-industrialization/): providing universal and affordable access to the Internet. Not one revenue stream will cover the costs of free Wi-Fi, but combining revenue streams from diverse sources has great potential.

**Q3 From your experience, how can public-private partnerships be utilised to increase impact of digital access programmes?**
In our experience, inter-sector partnerships are vital to bringing connectivity to all. Private-public partnerships in the telecommunications industry have never been as important as they are today. By collaborating, it is possible to speed up the building of infrastructure, and to pool the vast knowledge and experience of public and private agencies: Telecommunications is a fast-paced and ever-changing industry and these partnerships make truly innovative public service projects viable. For our work in particular, municipalities have valuable assets in public locations, high sites and provision of power. They can trade these assets to ensure that free Wi-Fi goes to the citizens who need it the most.  We see municipalities as key stakeholders and beneficiaries but the best drivers to make it succeed are wireless Internet service providers.

**Where is Project Isizwe now and what are your next steps?**
Presently, we are responsible for the facilitation of the biggest municipal subsidised Wi-Fi network in Africa in the Capital City of South Africa (Tshwane). We have over 1050 hotspots and provide free Wi-Fi to well over a million South African citizens. We also have various smaller projects across South Africa, such as in the Western Cape in the township of Khayelitsha, in Limpopo and other provinces.

Going forward, Project Isizwe will continue to lobby and advocate for Free WiFi, ensuring that citizens living in low income communities across South Africa are not left behind.

*Project Isizwe are running a conference in April 2018 in partnership with key South African government departments to pull municipalities and industry players together to answer ‘how do we sustain free Wi-Fi?’.
