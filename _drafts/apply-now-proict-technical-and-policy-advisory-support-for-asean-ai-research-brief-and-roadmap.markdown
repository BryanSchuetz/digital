[Digital Frontiers](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-digital-frontiers-df)’ ProICT activity seeks a consultant or team of consultants to write a Research Brief and a subsequent Artificial Intelligence (AI) Roadmap for The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member countries. The Research Brief and AI Roadmap will be shared at two convenings—or as required to incorporate substantive feedback and generate buy-in—and will be used to regularly and proactively solicit and incorporate input from relevant stakeholders. Proposals will be accepted from organizations/firms or independent consultants.

Collectively representing the fifth-largest global economy, ASEAN is a dynamic region with a population of 650 million. As one of the fastest-growing regional economies in the world, the 10 member states of ASEAN represent an economy of more than $3 trillion and an enormous market for US products. Nearly 42,000 US companies export to Southeast Asia, supporting 600,000 US jobs.

As part of the United States’ strategic approach to the Indo-Pacific, USAID prioritizes its cooperation with ASEAN. Partnering with ASEAN fosters regional economic growth, strengthens public health security, and reduces transboundary threats. USAID partners with ASEAN to promote unity, consensus-building, and solidarity to bolster ASEAN’s credibility, coordination, and institutional capacity to create policies and frameworks to implement endorsed commitments at the national level across ASEAN member states.

USAID’s flagship project working in the ASEAN economic pillar—the ASEAN-USAID Inclusive Growth in ASEAN through Innovation, Trade, and E-Commerce (IGNITE) project—promotes close collaboration with ASEAN sectoral bodies and the regional and global private sector. This project will be a close collaboration between the consultant(s), the USAID-IGNITE team, US Mission for ASEAN, and technical staff in Washington, DC.

ASEAN is increasingly focused on the emergence of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). AI is one of the rapidly evolving technologies expected to impact the region’s economic outlook significantly. In light of the potential economic gains and challenges that AI can offer, ASEAN must continue to work toward building AI ecosystems that are open, inclusive, and secure. As a whole, ASEAN lacks a coordinated regional approach and response to AI. As such, the ASEAN Secretariat (ASEC) requested USG assistance to tackle two main issues that ASEAN member states (AMS) are grappling with: (1) how to train ASEAN human capital to both work with and respond to AI, (2) and how AMS can respond to labor market impacts caused by the introduction of AI systems.
