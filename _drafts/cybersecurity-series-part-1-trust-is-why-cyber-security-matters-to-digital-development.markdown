At the heart of the Center for Digital Acceleration is a fundamental belief that digital tools can increase access to services for underserved communities around the world. Coupled with that aspiration is our investment in human-centered design, ecosystem mapping, and an assumption that trust in digital tools is a given.

But should we assume trust?

The response following the misuse of personal data by [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explained.html) or the hacking of [Equifax](https://money.cnn.com/2018/02/09/pf/equifax-hack-senate-disclosure/index.html), demonstrate that trust can be broken and doubt in digital tools can be proliferate.

As development professionals committed to leveraging digital access and tools that provide services globally, we must take securing trust in digital tools more seriously. This will require us to focus on cyber security.

Cyber security sounds daunting, particularly for people who associate the profession with dark rooms, humming computers, and coding expertise. This false impression, in my experience, stems from two misconceptions.

First, is the assumption that cyber security is too technical and therefore too difficult for non-techy’s to understand. Second, is the misunderstanding that cyber security is too difficult or costly to address when thinking about development initiatives. Both are false. But before getting into why they are false, lets zoom out and start with the basics.

To get to the heart of the matter, I spent an afternoon talking to Zach Gieske [\[GN1\]](#_msocom_1) a cyber security consultant to give me a rundown on the subject.

We started with the most basic of questions. *What is cybersecurity? *Zach defines cyber security as “the protection of information from misuse and unauthorized access in the digital space, given that today most information is in digital form.” The definition is comparable to that of the[ Merriam-Webster dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cybersecurity). Yet, to the average person working in development, what does this definition really mean for their day-today activities?

To understand that thread, Zach spent some time breaking down cyber security into its separate components. The exercise demonstrated to me what it actually means at a practical level and where there are opportunities to make a difference. Here is what I understood.

Cyber security breaks down into two specific components:

1) Access

2) Storage

Access, in this case, is different than how we in the digital development community[ understand it](https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/beyond-digital-divide/7557). When we are thinking about access for cyber security, it specifically means how do people get the data they are seeking.

Storage, then refers to the back-end of these systems, where the data we are sharing or the data we are requesting is being warehoused.

We interact with these components of cyber security every day. Think of your morning routine at work. You walk into the office and almost immediately login to your computer. Why? Because the computer is the portal to all the relevant information you might need to complete your tasks. You’re granted access to this, by providing your key- your login and password.

Once you’ve entered that information, you automatically trust that the information you are requesting or the people you are communicating with via email are the individuals they say they are. We trust that the system is protected.

Unfortunately, no system can be fully protected, rather we can build within it resiliency measures. According to Zach, “it’s much more difficult to retrofit security protocols after a tool has been launched. Therefore, it’s better to consider security at the design stage.” As digital development practitioners, this should come as no surprise, as we already invest heavily in designing tools that meet end-users needs and consider digital literacy levels.

Adding resiliency measures to that design process can come at no added significant cost to a project. What it really requires is thinking through a checklist of different aspects of a tool you’re designing and answering who might have access to that aspect of the tool. For example, imagine your project is in the process of developing a data collection tool to track health indicators, monitor disease outbreak, and gives individuals access to their own health records. Two obvious aspects of this tool are the end-users themselves who access their personal information through the tool and the back-end users who are analyze everyone’s data to identify trends. Answering who on the back-end has access to all the data is one easy step to building resiliency. This could be followed by a workshop with end-users on the importance of creating strong passwords, another major vulnerability to any system storing personal data.

By investing in these capacity building and governance measures surrounding the use and access of digital tools, we as digital development professionals can ensure that we do not inadvertently erode trust in the tools we believe have the potential to increase access to critical services for more people globally.

Part 2 of this mini-series will delve into the cyber security topic further.
