COVID-19 has caused major disruptions in all walks of life, everywhere in the world. It has dramatically changed activities we used to do in person, especially activities that brought together people from different places with the goals of knowledge exchange and strengthening relationships. Specifically, uncertainty over whether or how in-person education and training can continue as the pandemic evolves has preemptively moved many types of learning online, especially for adults.

At the Center for Digital Acceleration, we see significant areas of opportunity here for creative digital collaborations that would have been impossible even one year ago. eLearning has emerged as a particularly interesting category for development solutions. Projects with goals that span the thematic spectrum – from improving supply chains, to supporting rule of law, to stemming climate change – are considering how to implement digital curricula and thinking carefully about what could work best for their myriad stakeholder groups.

As practitioners actively consider eLearning and other remote learning solutions in new ways, based on our experiences working through these processes at the Center for Digital Acceleration, we have three key recommendations for best practices to begin this complex process:

1\. **Decouple content and technology.** While it might be intuitive for some people to first think about the way they want the finished eLearning project to look, or the type of platform they want to have, we recommend taking a step back to think about the learning objectives and content that will need to be delivered given the reality of the end users’ context. It’s particularly important for a project to have a clear sense of the purpose of the eLearning course they want to develop and consider how much external support or guidance learners might need considering their contexts. For example, in a low-resourced context with limited internet availability and bandwidth, an exclusively video-based course would likely not be a viable solution, even if the videos are well thought out and professionally produced. Technology solutions should serve the content and course execution, not the other way around.

2\. **Understand technology solutions.** In order for technology solutions to best support project learning goals, decision-makers require a clear understanding of what these different technology solutions specifically offer. A Learning Management System (LMS) has different functionalities than a Content Management System (CMS), and both are more formal and structured than standard digital communications tools that are often repurposed for the same ends. To know what tool is right for any particular remote learning project, understanding what the tool does and (perhaps more importantly) what it does not do, is key.

3\. **Plan for sustainability from the beginning.** How will the course be maintained while it is available? What will happen if learners want to review material on their own? What will happen to the course after the project closes? The answers to questions like these are fundamental in determining what type of technology will best serve knowledge activities for different projects. Open-source solutions, such as the Moodle LMS platform, are generally considered to be more sustainable since they do not require expensive licensing fees. But they do require more hands-on technology support, especially as the course is actively being developed. These are trade-offs that any project needs to consider within a broader framework of sustainability.

Ultimately, the technology options available for remote learning are vast and can be adapted for most contexts and circumstances. What we have consistently found to be most important when determining what will “work” is keeping the learning objectives and learners’ contexts at the forefront of decision-making. As in all good project management, it’s stakeholder response and engagement that will determine whether the effort is successful – all the more reason to keep learners front and center in this process.
