F8, [Facebook's annual conference](https://www.fbf8.com/), was my first trip to Silicon Valley - I've been to the Silicon Wadi (Israel) and the Silicon Savannah (Kenya), but never had I stepped foot where the OG magic happens. It was the perfect sort of baptism by fire into the mentality and ethos of the place that brought us personal computing, smartphones and the internet: a gathering where the future is dreamed up by developers and defined by technology's limitless potential. It was wild.

I'll outline below a few of the innovations that I think are particularly relevant to the work we do in ICT, and then make an argument for why the practice of ICT4D is more important than ever.

## Augmented Reality: Post-it notes 2.0

When we think of augmented reality (AR), we think of googles and lenses and other bulky, awkward apparatus we have to strap to our face to experience AR. One of Facebook's big themes of F8 was that there already is an augmented reality platform on billions of smartphones: a camera. Facebook has already rolled out a camera and filters and effects (a la Snapchat) to its app in recent months. At F8, they launched their next round of AR deployment: a more advanced AR, capable of recognizing individual objects in videos, blending the real world with animated objects, and creating 3D scenes from 2D photos. This means, for example, that you could hold your camera up to a room and see notes or objects other folks have left you there. The demo they showed us at F8 was someone leaving a beer recommendation note in a bar for a friend, but I immediately thought of all the amazing geo-tagged advice and training you could roll out in say, an agriculture program, complete with both written notes and the integration of object recognition (machinery or crops) and animated objects (see how a tool can be used to enhance irrigation). Obviously this will take awhile (though I imagine not as long as the skeptics among us think) to roll out to developing world markets in terms of device and bandwidth readiness, but those days are coming and I am excited for them.
