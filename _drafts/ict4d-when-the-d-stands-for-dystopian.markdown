We've written quite a bit on this blog recently about growing concerns over [internet governance](https://dai-global-digital.com/what-makes-this-wireless-technology-5g-different-than-all-other-wireless-technologies.html?utm_source=related-box) and the importance of the digital development community taking a more [proactive and educated approach to cybersecurity](https://dai-global-digital.com/cybersecurity-series-part-1-trust-is-why-cyber-security-matters-to-digital-development.html?utm_source=related-box). One of the main drivers of this push for greater awareness of cyber issues, is the consistent stream of reports coming out that detail the myriad of ways in which China is developing, using and exporting technologies that enable and advance authoritarian governance and state surveillance. Given that China is one of the main providers of internet infrastructure (including 5G) and surveillance technology to developing countries under its massive "[Belt and Road Initiative](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiative)", it is crucial that those of us working in digital development are aware of these dystopian applications of digital tools. Chinese tech companies supply artificial intelligence surveillance (AIS) technology in 63 countries, according to a [September 2019 report](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/09/17/global-expansion-of-ai-surveillance-pub-79847) by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. While it is important to note that it is not only China supplying AIS tech - U.S., Israel and France are also active exporters of this type of technology - Chinese sales tactics are particularly troubling. According to the same report, Chinese product pitches are often accompanied by soft loans to encourage governments to purchase their equipment. These tactics are particularly relevant in countries where development professionals often work. For instance, Kenya, Laos, Mongolia, Uganda, and Uzbekistanâ€”which otherwise might not access this technology.![facial recognition.jpg](/uploads/facial%20recognition.jpg)`Image via www.vpnsrus.com`

In case you haven't been following this issue as closely as we have, here's a few key articles we've been reading lately to get you up to speed on the troubling news coming out of China.

1. **Chinese use of DNA to Map Ethnic Minority Groups**: This [NYTimes piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/business/china-dna-uighurs-xinjiang.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share) is a terrifying read on its own, but even more so to think about what widespread application of this type of technology would result in countries with a history of ethnic persecution like Myanmar.

2. **SIM Card Face Scanning in China**: In related news, all new SIM card holders in China must now get their face scanned. This [MIT Technology Review piece](https://www.technologyreview.com/f/614781/all-new-cellphone-users-in-china-must-now-have-their-face-scanned/) briefly highlights how this new role relates to much broader UN regulation about facial recognition global governance (see below).

3. **Chinese Tech Companies are Shaping UN Regulations**: The [International Telecommunication Union](https://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx) is the UN body dedicated to providing standards for technologies like mobile spectrum and, increasingly, advanced technology like artificial intelligence.  Standards ratified in the ITU are often adopted as policies by developing countries, especially in Africa where governments generally lack the resources to develop bespoke policies themselves. As reported across multiple agencies, Chinese companies who export AIS technology are working hard to influence ITU standards on facial recognition. Writing standards gives companies an edge in market as they are able to craft regulations to fit the specifications of their own proprietary technology. According to the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/c3555a3c-0d3e-11ea-b2d6-9bf4d1957a67), in recent years, Chinese companies have been increasing their influence in international standards-setting bodies, such as the ITU and ISO. 

International development actors recognize the risks of China's growing influence, such as the US's whole-of-government Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership. Just today it was [announced that the new U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) plans to tap some of its $60 billion budget ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-03/u-s-to-tap-60-billion-war-chest-in-boon-for-huawei-rivals)to help developing countries and businesses purchase equipment from companies other than Chinese telecommunications giants Huawei and ZTE. 

 As digital development professionals, it will be crucial that we engage in the discussions about cybersecurity, facial recognition standards, and user rights to ensure that this DFC financing (and other future financing) is coupled with robust data governance, ethics and digital literacy programming.
