A combination of mainstream media attention and Elon Musk's Twitter feed has reignited the public interest in distributed ledger technologies, commonly referred to as blockchain. DAI's Center for Digital Acceleration (CDA) is no stranger to this technology – check out our previous blog postings for a comprehensive overview of [blockchain](https://dai-global-digital.com/blockchain-for-development-part-1-understanding-the-tech.html) and how CDA has [applied this concept in-house](https://dai-global-digital.com/getting-past-the-blockchain-hype-cycle.html). We felt now was the time to revisit blockchain's role in international development to assess whether the technology is beyond the peak of the [hype cycle](https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle) and ready for sustainable long-term deployment.

Over the last decade, international donors and the private sector have used blockchain across focus areas such as financial inclusion, digital government, and supply chain management. Applications leverage the technology's ability to decrease transaction costs, maintain an immutable record, and provide users with privacy. Below are several examples from these three focus areas and what they tell us about blockchain's future in the development sector.

## Financial Inclusion

Blockchain-based applications are popular within the FinTech sector and aspire to make financial services more accessible to the planet’s [1.7 billion unbanked](https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/sites/globalfindex/files/chapters/2017%20Findex%20full%20report_chapter2.pdf) individuals. Blockchain is used to transfer and receive mobile money payments securely and records cryptocurrency transactions. In Southeast Asia, the mobile money app [coins.ph](https://coins.ph/) uses blockchain to provide their 10 million customers with access to digital payments, remittances, and cryptocurrencies. Users directly engage with one another over their mobile phones, removing expensive remittance service fees and time delays in cash transfers. In Kenya, the business-to-business mobile money platform [BitPesa](https://www.coindesk.com/company/bitpesa) uses blockchain to mitigate exchange risk between African markets and improve cross-border lending. And [El Salvador](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2021/08/05/could-developing-nations-follow-el-salvadors-move-to-bitcoin/?sh=11b42c528b70), became the first-ever country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender to increase citizens' ability to collect remittances at zero cost.

Blockchain-based applications also support financial inclusion by providing formal identification (ID) to the [40% of individuals](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/953621531854471275/Global-ID-Coverage-Barriers-and-Use-by-the-Numbers-Insights-from-the-ID4D-Findex-Survey.pdf) in low-income countries without ID. In developing contexts, obtaining a physical ID can be time-consuming and laborious, restricting access to the financial sector. However, digital ID programs accessible through mobile devices or biometrics use blockchain to securely store private or sensitive information onto a decentralized ledger. In Sierra Leone, [the National Digital Identity Platform (NDIP) uses the Kiva Protocol](https://www.kiva.org/blog/kivas-next-frontier-kiva-protocol), Africa's first public blockchain, to provide Sierra Leone's unbanked population with a secure identification number via their thumbprint. The platform uses blockchain to anonymously record each financial transaction, helping unbanked individuals develop a credit history for future loans. The World Food Program also uses blockchain to augment its digital ID program and improve financial inclusion. The [Building Blocks](https://innovation.wfp.org/project/building-blocks) platform leverages the UNHCR’s existing biometric system and uses a blockchain to deploy smart contracts which directly transfer cash assistance to Syrian refugees in Jordan. The program provides this vulnerable group with an ID, allows for transparent cash transfers, and empowers beneficiaries to use funds as they desire.

## Digital Government

Blockchain-backed applications not only provide digital ID for financial inclusion but are helping the public sector digitize public records and securely store information. As the push for digital government (or ‘e-governance’) continues to gain steam in developing countries, blockchain will be critical for ensuring information security and data privacy. Estonia is a leading nation in e-governance and blockchain, where [99% of public services](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/legal/tech/assets/estonia-the-digital-republic-secured-by-blockchain.pdf) are available as e-services. The country has successfully digitized public services such as voting, tax collection, and land records through blockchain-backed platforms that instantly verify and upload information. Such a use makes public services more efficient and can improve social accountability by making government more transparent.

## Supply Chain Management

Due to blockchain’s immutable and precise record-keeping, the technology is found throughout supply chain innovations. The agricultural sector is particularly keen on incorporating blockchain into their supply chains to have a complete picture of where, when, and how agricultural inputs move throughout the value chain. Blockchain improves transparency in the supply chain between parties, reducing information asymmetries and lowering transaction costs – helping smallholder farmers to receive fair compensation. For example, in Fiji, [TraSeable](https://www.traseable.com/about/) is a local start-up providing fisheries and farmers with blockchain-ready software that relies on Internet of Things technology to verify a product's end-to-end journey through the value chain. By linking blockchain with other digital tools, such as sensors and mobile phones, the technology works holistically and helps consumers or regulators better understand food's journey. Blockchain's immutable record also makes the technology valuable to combat counterfeit products. For example, the [Government of Maharashtra in India uses an Ethereum Blockchain](https://www.businessinsider.in/cryptocurrency/news/maharashtra-karnataka-and-telangana-plan-to-use-ethereum-in-their-fight-against-fake-degrees/articleshow/84823688.cms) to record university degrees to prevent degree fraud, while the [MediLedger Network](https://www.mediledger.com/) uses blockchain to combat counterfeit pharmaceuticals.

## Is the Hype Sustainable?

But is the international development community at the point where blockchain will reinvent the sector and our daily lives? Personally, I'm unconvinced. While blockchain’s use cases have become more widespread, especially in financial inclusion, most applications are still pilot projects and face scalability issues. Technological limitations, such as a [larger environmental footprint](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22256-3) and [slower transaction speeds](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-blockchain-scalability-problem-the-race-for-visa-like-transaction-speed-5cce48f9d44), create barriers that will have to be overcome before the technology becomes common in our daily lives. International financial institutions such as The World Bank and government regulators remain skeptical about cryptocurrencies, [often citing transparency and environmental concerns](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57507386), limiting their uptake in emerging markets. And while blockchain can revolutionize supply chains, the technology will only add-value when the data individuals add to a blockchain is indeed correct and consistent. Most importantly, for blockchain-backed programs to improve life in developing countries - digital access, affordability, and literacy will have to be more readily available to distribute development gains equally and ensure this technology does not widen existing inequalities. Blockchain certainly does hold promise and could revolutionize the future, but for now, this technology likely has not passed the hype cycle's peak and is still years off from large-scale uptake in the development sector.
