When the war in Ukraine comes to an end (hopefully with Ukraine having recovered all of its territory, including Crimea), Western countries are likely to provide a massive aid package to help rebuild Ukrainian infrastructure, buildings and lives. This moment in history will offer an opportunity for Ukraine to engage in rapid digital transformation. We should already begin deploying digital tools that will help Ukraine as it continues to fight bravely against the invaders, with the intention of seeing the country emerge from war on the right foot for a quick recovery. As President Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself [said](https://www.anews.com.tr/world/2022/07/03/zelensky-calls-for-international-assistance-to-rebuild-ukraine) the post-war reconstruction should use the moment to build “a new foundation for our lives: safe, modern, comfortable, accessible”. “colossal investments, billions, new technologies, best practices, new institutions and, of course, reforms.”

## Дія Platform

One prominent digital tool that is improving Ukraine’s digital governance is the Diia ([Дія](https://diia.gov.ua/)) platform, which the Ministry of Digital Transformation formally launched in 2020. The name is formed by combining derzhava, the Ukrainian word for state, and ya, the word for me, to mean “the state and me”. The platform now includes dozens of automated government services and storage for officially recognized digital versions of several key personal documents like drivers licenses, national identity cards, passports, car registrations and covid vaccine certificates. If you get stopped by the police, you can show them the documents on your phone, without any need for the physical version. It also includes job listings; grants for gardens, a national test for digital literacy, an application platform for cash assistance for citizens fleeing the war; online courses and more.

The popularity of Diia is exploding. In 2021 [there were 12 million Diia users](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-society/3374535-number-of-diia-app-users-has-grown-almost-fivefold-over-year.html). By August 2022, the number [had grown to 18 million](https://twitter.com/FedorovMykhailo/status/1562043296679165952), with 50,000-70,000 users joining daily. Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Transformation (and friend of Zelensky) Mykhailo Fedorov has many remaining ambitions for Diia, his signature achievement. He had actually unveiled it in September 2019, just three weeks after the ministry itself was formed!

Diia is quickly expanding its services. In August, Diia [launched a service](https://babel.ua/en/news/82703-diia-will-accept-applications-for-compensation-for-housing-destroyed-by-the-russians-since-2014) for people to register property damaged or lost due to Russian aggression in Ukraine, including as far back as 2014, when Russian began occupying Crimea. While citizens can apply now, the Diia a commission will be formed at a later date to assess damage claims. Soon the government will use it to make pension payments.

Minister Fedorov has the noble ambition of tackling petty corruption by moving small official transactions, such as applying for a building permit or obtaining any kind of license, to Diia as well. And in August, he [announced](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mykhailo-fedorov-9670b4a3/recent-activity/shares/) integration of Diia with Poland’s myObywatel digital governance platform.

Given the threat a democratic, Western-oriented Ukraine poses to Putin’s desire to bring it back under his authoritarian control, it was perhaps not surprising that Russians [tried to hack](https://babel.ua/ru/news/76723-hakery-nachali-atakovat-i-portal-diya) Diia just ten days before the war started. It spoke well of Ukraine’s cybersecurity that the attack failed and users didn’t even notice it was happening.

## Contrasting Diia to a predecessor

Diia is very close to the preexisting concept promoted by none other than father of the internet Sir Tim-Berners Lee, who has long been dissatisfied with the extent of personal information held by companies and platforms like Google and Facebook.

He envisioned personal online databases (PODs) as an antidote to the dominant role these platforms play in our personal lives. They would serve as a virtual place, maintained on- or offline, where a person’s documents and credentials are stored. They would enable individuals to have a digital self-sovereign identity (SSI) that would promise to alleviate the need for logging into sites with a username and password.

While it is similar, since Diia is purely state run and focused on official processes, it doesn’t fulfill the dream of an SSI, that is controlled by individuals and interoperable with commercial platforms. Yet, PODs haven’t really taken off yet globally and SSI hasn’t yet gone mainstream. While in 2020 the city of Flanders, Belgium purchased PODs for all its citizens, there don’t appear to have been much uptake elsewhere.

## Six Digital Transformation Tools for Ukraine
Building on the Ukrainian government’s readiness to improve digital governance, here are some digitalization ideas it (and we) could get started developing now:

1. Establish a National Digital Hryvnia Currency
As compared to decentralized digital currency like Bitcoin, a digital hryvnia would be issued and controlled by the National Bank of Ukraine. (Thankfully, though, it would not run on a blockchain.) Each digital hryvnia would have its own unique identification number, just as each physical US dollar has a unique serial number and can be tracked along its journey through transaction after transaction. This would help tremendously with tracking how reconstruction funds were spent. And with increased international trust will come increased support.

The idea of a national digital currency (also called a central bank digital currency, or CBDC) is not new. The US Federal Reserve is considering a digital dollar. And in 2021 Ukraine’s friends across the Black Sea in Georgia launched their own digital currency, in large part to stem corruption (and to allow enable instant payments and, eventually, smart contracts). And in 2020 the National Bank of Ukraine considered the idea.

Obviously digitizing payments across the entire reconstruction value chain will make things more efficient, particularly if integrated with a digital hryvnia. And, in addition to digital currencies’ promise to lower the cost of capital (printing money, stocking ATMs, transporting it in bulletproof vehicles), just imagine the challenging, expensive logistics of providing cash in areas with decimated infrastructure. But the aim here is also behavior change all the way down to the most remote village, to lay a foundation that over the long-term moves the society and economy towards the benefits of a cashless economy.
