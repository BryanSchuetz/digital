I find it difficult to use this word in this context, but there may be one **positive**—if collateral—effect of COVID-19: it looks like decades of the digital development community working with consumers and businesses around the world to get them to adopt digital technologies has been accelerated in mere months. There’s a new willingness among both consumers and businesses to embrace the digital economy, using digital tools out of necessity as in-person interactions are forced online. This process, often called digital transformation, has been written about by a variety of sources, outlining both the benefits and the risks. We thought it might be helpful to provide an overview of some of the articles, blogs and resources that we are reading as leverage this momentum. This list is by no means exhaustive, but rather provides a few highlights to get you started.  I’ve broken down the readings into three, highly academic categories: 1. This is really happening, 2. and the benefits could be huge, 3. but please do not forget the risks.

**This is really happening…**

All you need to do is search “digital transformation of the economy” and you will quickly find data about how digital transformation is happening at a rapid pace. McKinsey released a [study](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tippinghttps:/www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever-point-and-transformed-business-forever) that showed that the rates of adoption are years ahead of when they previously conducted this survey, stating that “respondents are three times likelier now than before the crisis to say that at least 80 percent of their customer interactions are digital in nature”. This phenomenon is especially true in the Asia-Pacific region where the study affirms that adoption has been acceleration by 10\+ years.

Forbes similarly cited a [study](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/09/10/97-of-executives-say-covid-19-sped-up-digital-transformation/?sh=36b77e0a4799) that concluded that 97% of executives say the pandemic sped up their digital transformation, 95% say they’re looking for new ways to engage customers, and 79% say Covid-19 increased budgets for digital transformation. But, as I’ll discuss in risks section, there are regions that are left behind in this wave.

**...And the benefits could be huge…**

The rapid rate at which businesses across the world have been adopting digital technologies has led to benefits beyond what we had predicted. The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs published a report called “[Frontier Technology Issues: Can digital technologies put us back on the path to achieve the SDGs?”](https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/publication/frontier-technology-issues-can-digital-technologies-put-us-back-on-the-path-to-achieve-the-sdgs/) which discusses how technology adoption in a post-COVID-19 world is actually helping accelerate achievements toward SDGs. First, it outlines how digital technology adopting has contributed to the evolution of labor markets, generating new opportunities in decent work, enabling remote work, and actually helping people transition to new jobs and industries. Second, it dives into the use of technologies to improve health services and outcomes. No one will debate that COVID-19 has disrupted health systems across the world, but it also forced health providers to adopt new tools such as telemedicine to reach their patients. Lastly, COVID-19 has forced education systems to rethink learning, which, while a major concern, has shown the power of digital tools in enabling education to continue through both high-tech and low-tech solutions, such as TV, radio and mobile phones. This report does not ignore the challenges posed by COVID-19 in these three areas nor the growing digital divide, but rather provides a perspective on how digital transformation of the labor market, healthcare and education are important to recognize.

Another blog by UNDP talks about how digital transformation can and will lead to a greener economy. [The piece ](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/blog/2020/how-covid-19-has-sped-up-digital-transformation.html)talks about the technology trends that are picking up steam: drones that map disaster risks, spatial data on forest management efforts, and fintech solutions that encourage sustainable activities. The blog goes into more detail on examples across the world, from the GCash Forest Platform in the Philippines to the use of a cryptocurrency in Lebanon that plants a tree for every coin purchased.

**…But please do not forget the risks.**

While the rate of digital transformation is exciting and demonstrates potential for lasting change in the use of digital technologies, many resources – including those listed above-- also outline the risks associated with this change. Going digital is in no way a panacea to the effects of COVID-19 on the economy and broader social systems. Equally as important, is the ever-growing digital divide. Countries and communities left behind in the gradual shift toward digital technology risk being further left behind during this seismic shift. A great resource on this is UNECE and the Portulans Institute’s [Network Readiness Report Index 2020: Accelerating Digital Transformation in post-COVID Global Economy.](https://networkreadinessindex.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NRI-2020-V8_28-11-2020.pdf) It discusses how Africa continues to struggle with improving access, affordability and usage of internet and digital tools and that the “ripple effect” of digital transformation due to COVID-19 on the global economy will enhance the “divergences between network-ready economies and laggards”.

If we dig into one portion of the economy -- micro and small businesses or ‘MSMEs’ -- we also see this widening divide. The World Economy Forum published an article entitled [COVID-19 has intensified the digital divide](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/09/covid-19-has-intensified-the-digital-divide/) that talks about MSMEs around the world that have relied on face-to-face interactions to do business, now have to adapt at a rapid pace when Internet access is limited and the costs of digital tools may be prohibitively high. “Suddenly, access to technology became another source of inequality and vulnerability for millions of small retailers in our value chain” and many MSMEs were not able to connect to consumers and meet the digital demand.

These are just a few of many resources on digital transformation in a COVID-19 world and more and more studies are being done every day to determine the long-term effects of this shift in economies around the world. Stay tuned!
