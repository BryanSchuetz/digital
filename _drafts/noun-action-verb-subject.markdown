The Pacific Islands have the [lowest rate of mobile internet penetration](https://www.pacificislandtimes.com/post/2020/01/04/the-connectivity-gap-in-the-pacific) in the world and fixed broadband connection levels far below that of their Asia Pacific neighbors. Recent and planned investments in building out undersea fibre optic cable and satellite services – including those financed by the United Nations, World Bank and Asian Development Bank – are striving to change this, boosting internet speeds and expanding access to citizens, governments and businesses across the region. In recent weeks I’ve spoken with a number of experts in the Pacific Islands about their concerns and priorities in regard to this rapid increase in internet access and speed. Below I present a few common themes that resonated throughout my conversations.

## Fears Accompany Opportunity

As an economy largely dependent on tourism, the Pacific Islands have suffered devastating economic losses as a result of Covid-19. Many Pacific Islanders are embracing the opportunities and economic growth potential that increased internet access and speed can support, such as students engaging in distance learning and business owners utilizing digital payments. Some people, however, remain concerned about the known and unknown risks that might accompany widespread internet access. Fears around cyberviolence toward women and girls, access to pornography, and social media as a platform for political criticism can be tied to historically patriarchal societies, the predominance of Christianity, and a traditional reverence for authority.
Others ponder the existential question of what impact a dependence on smartphones could have on societal norms and traditions. A religious leader in Fiji emphasized the importance of relationships as a critical pillar of Pacific culture. He acknowledged that technology has the potential to foster greater connections between Pacific Islanders – increasingly important as the region experiences what many consider to be its [first real lockdowns after 12 months Covid-free](https://theconversation.com/the-pacific-went-a-year-without-covid-now-its-all-under-threat-158963) – yet worries about eroding family dynamics if teenagers and parents alike cannot disconnect from their devices for meaningful person-to-person engagement. A look at the almost [constant internet engagement by American teens](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/08/screen-time-parents-teens/568081/)  only validates this concern.

## The Importance of Online Safety and Media Literacy Education

Beyond the hurdles to ICT access and affordability and the hesitancy of some to embrace the internet, looms another important question. Do nascent internet users have the skills and know-how to navigate the digital landscape safely and responsibly? In the United States, the public’s experience with computers, then internet connectivity, and eventual smart phone adoption was gradual, with “Digital Natives” guiding the way for “Digital Immigrants”. This isn’t necessarily the case in developing countries where entire communities of [“Digital Explorers”](https://dai-global-digital.com/beyond-features-designing-for-the-worlds-digital-explorers.html) are rapidly coming online en masse, often skipping computers altogether and going straight to smart phones. Digital connectivity invites numerous vulnerabilities that plague digital natives and immigrants alike. Let’s consider a few of the risks to unequipped Digital Explorers:
* Phishing scams: Will new users know that the email from the Nigerian prince urgently needing their bank account details is not to be trusted? Or not to provide their personal information in response to a lottery scam?
* Cyber hygiene: As new users begin to conduct banking and financial transactions online, will they understand the importance of secure passwords and multi-factor authentication?
*
