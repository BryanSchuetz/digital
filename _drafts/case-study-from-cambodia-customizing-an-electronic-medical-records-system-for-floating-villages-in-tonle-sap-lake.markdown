How do you digitize medical records in Cambodia when [your clinics are on a lake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DRZBiE6BTE), have minimal Internet connectivity, and are four hours away from the nearest big city? Impossible, you say?? Not quite. Let me introduce you to [the Lake Clinic](https://www.lakeclinic.org/) (TLC), a health clinic working to solve this complex challenge with the support of the six-year, USAID-funded [Development Innovations (DI)](https://www.development-innovations.org) project. TLC is the only health clinic in Cambodia that provides free medical care and outreach to people living in the remote floating villages on Tonle Sap Lake.

Every week, TLC staff travel four hours from their head office in Siem Reap City to the floating clinics, where they serve approximately 50-60 patients a day. Before they started to work with DI in 2016, TLC used a paper-based system to manage and maintain patient information. This left records vulnerable to damage from natural disasters, humidity, fire, and insects. And service delivery suffered, since having to write, organize and transmit handwritten notes cut into the time clinicians could have been spending with their patients. Clearly, something had to change.

To digitize their patient management system, TLC partnered with a technology service provider, Mekom Solutions, with funding support from DI. TLC and [Mekom Solutions](https://mekomsolutions.com/) customized a free and secure open source system called [Open Medical Record System (OpenMRS).](https://openmrs.org/)

To customize OpenMRS for their needs, TLC worked with a wide variety of stakeholders to provide technical inputs (like on clinical informatics), including several local and international healthcare professionals, other international development implementers, and – most critically – a ICT Coordinator, otherwise known as a “tech whisperer.” This ICT Coordinator helped TLC communicate with Mekom Solutions’ developers about the clinicians’ requirements for the OpenMRS, essentially ‘translating’ between the medical professionals at TLC and the technology professionals at Mekom Solutions.

After extensive user testing with TLC staff in the floating clinics and several rounds of iteration on this tech tool, TLC and Mekom Solutions built an OpenMRS platform with simple user interface that captures even more information than their paper-based system ever had. Instead of offline functionality – which was tried and tested during the iteration phase – TLC’s OpenMRS system uses mobile hotspots to connect to the internet and upload the patient records.

Since rolling out the customized OpenMRS platform at TLC clinics, more than 14 clinicians have used the system to deliver outpatient services across five floating clinics in eight villages in Siem Reap and Kampong Thom Province. The system has recorded more than 5,000 patients with 11,000 visits and 28,000 cases.  Clinicians report saving at least 5-10 minutes were saved per patient with OpenMRS.![TLC pic 2.png](/uploads/TLC%20pic%202.png)

So, what did the DI team learn from its experience with TLC?

* Employ a “Tech Whisperer” to Bridge the Communication Gap. Development organizations and NGOs often have trouble communicating with technologists about their project requirements, because technologists often possess a limited understanding of development challenges and development organizations’ goals and focus narrowly on technology solutions. A “tech whisperer” can help bridge the communication gap by simplifying technology-related language and international development jargon, facilitate problem identification, brainstorm appropriate solutions, and train users on new tech solutions.

* Design the System to [Meet the User’s Needs](https://dai-global-digital.com/5-tips-for-doing-international-design-research.html).  The project team should focus on [understanding the problems](https://dai-global-digital.com/app-ui.html) of their target users. For example, according to the TLC staff, at first the digital consultation screening took too long to complete. Based on feedback, the developers made changes to the form to reduce the number of clicks and replace text entry questions with multiple choice selections. In addition, the system itself should incentivize usage. The system should not increase the clinicians’ burden, but instead improve their quality of work so they want to use it. [Users should be engaged](https://dai-global-digital.com/nobody-cares-what-tech-you-use.html) through the [design and iteration process](https://www.development-innovations.org/blog/tips-tricks-design/) by testing prototypes and giving feedback.

* Use an [Iterative Process](https://dai-global-digital.com/cambodia-second-chance-fund.html) when Developing the System. Developing a new digital tool does not happen overnight. It takes time and effort to prototype, test, integrate feedback, and improve the system. In TLC’s case, the system was initially developed to work in an online environment, based on the assumption that all floating clinics had good connectivity. However, when the first version of the system was rolled out to the floating clinics, the team identified that two out of five clinics did not have stable connectivity. After many subsequent rounds of testing, the combined TLC and Mekom team finally found an appropriate solution to the connectivity challenge. The process of assessing the problems the target users are facing, [exploring potential solutions](https://dai-global-digital.com/lean-design-for-development-a-practical-approach-to-human-centered-design.html), prototyping, testing and iterating multiple times can help ensure that the proposed system meets the needs of the users.

* Consider Confidentiality and [User Privacy](https://dai-global-digital.com/beyond-good-intentions-a-human-centred-approach-to-privacy-rights.html). OpenMRS is used to record patients’ personal information as well as medical histories. That information is kept confidential and used only for the purpose of providing medical care. Not all Cambodian citizens have a strong understanding of the importance of data confidentiality. However, clinics seeking to customize OpenMRS in the future will need to consider patients’ privacy and data security, ensuring that both developers and implementers use the data responsibly and patients are protected.

* Conduct Regular Trainings for Users of the System. No matter how user-friendly a system may be, regular training is necessary to ensure a successful use of the system. The clinicians, as the end users, will need to understand the system as a whole and how it operates. This enables them to identify problems as they arise and fix minor issues. Staff also need to be trained on new features as the system adapts.  Training is especially important at TLC clinics, because they have volunteers who cycle in and out on a regular basis.

This example with TLC and Mekom Solutions shows the importance of starting small, [designing with the user in mind](https://www.development-innovations.org/blog/why-do-we-care-about-user-research/), iterating on tech prototypes, and working with skilled professionals who can bridge the gap between technology and international development. We encourage all development practitioners working in technology to take these lessons learned to improve their programming and design more effective tech tools.
