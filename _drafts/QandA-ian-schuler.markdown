As a kick off to #Geekfest2017, our series of interviews with ICT4D thought leaders, meet [Ian Schuler](https://developmentseed.org/team/ian-schuler/), the CEO of [Development Seed](https://www.developmentseed.org/), one of the lead organizers and sponsors for the upcoming [SatSummit](https://satsummit.io/). From his early professional days at the U.S. Department of State to founding the ICT team at the National Democratic Institute and now as CEO at DevSeed, Ian has been passionate about using the most appropriate technologies to understand what is happening and use that knowledge to pragmatic development activities and solutions. DevSeed’s 2016 highlights can be seen here in their [Annual Report](https://developmentseed.org/blog/2017/01/05/annual-report/).

### As you prepare for SatSummit, what trends in the field of satellite imagery and data and international development are on your mind?

* **Remote sensing work** - We’ve seen an uptick in requests for remote sensing work.  More requests and more thoughtful requests are coming to us – especially around satellite imagery.  Before, only a handful of people were really thinking about using this type of data and imagery.  Now, with increased outreach from private sector providers like Planet Labs, Digital Globe, and Terra Bella which have led to press from Wired and other media, people are really starting to catch-on to the possibilities.

The truth is that the potential is there for satellite imagery to make a huge difference but there is still a lot of work to be done to really focus on decision maker’s needs. There is a danger that due to the increased attention to satellite imagery – people might think it can solve all problems – rather than being the best fit to solve a specific problem.  I’ve seen this before with certain technologies that show promise – such as the Ushahidi platform when it first came out. Ushahidi’s first uses were so compelling that people wanted to use it for all sorts of things – including some things for which it wasn’t appropriate – before eventually figuring out how best to apply it.  SatSummit is an attempt to shorten this learning curve at this uniquely exciting and confusing moment in time.

* **Advancements in computing** – Now, with advancements and more common advanced graphics cards the ability to use view and use images has be unlocked for more and more people. And Amazon Web Services can host, process, and extract value from data.  Before, we had to call up imagery providers and get data downloaded and sent to us…via actual mail.  We’ve come a long way in the last 3 years.

* **User-focused data products** – In the past, we got lots of requests for data-dump dashboards.  This “vomit” of data was practically useless for most people.  Now, there is so much more focus on the user as decision maker.  And this – combined with the advancements in availability and computer - has the potential to increase accessibility to relevant, useful data, and make data available for regular use.

### How is this year’s SatSummit distinct from last time?

When we out together SatSummit Round 1, we were not sure that would be a Round 2.  People were so positive the day of the event and afterward and we knew it needed to be done again.  The goal of the last one was to get people together – some of whom had never been in the same room before.  It was all about making connections among those facing similar problems.  And then, to see how we could be doing better to help the industry based on available data.

This time, we’ll repeat some of the “state of play” presentations that people found most useful, and we’ve kept these and added more voices from open source data providers, people working in the field, and those working on specific technical problems – like sharing imagery for disaster response or mosquito mapping or using machine learning for human rights violations mapping -  that may only be of interest to a dozen or so attendees at a time. We’ve also incorporated the Sustainable Development Goals and the end users. And of course, we kept the networking happy hour afterwards.

### What does success look like coming out of SatSummit?

We are excited to see how much we can accomplish together with the small group sessions we have as part of the day. These – we hope – will lead to really pragmatic, cross-organizational solutions to how we can do a better job reaching people after an earthquake, or monitor crop health over large areas, or manage disease outbreaks.  This can happen through the informed mind share cultivated at SatSummit so that people are designing better projects and writing more informed proposals.
