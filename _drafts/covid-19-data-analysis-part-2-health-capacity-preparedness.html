*This article was written by DAI's [Jamie Parr](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-parr-4a534897/), with contributions from [Greg Maly](https://dai-global-digital.com/authors/greg-maly/), and [Gratiana Fu](https://dai-global-digital.com/authors/gratiana-fu/). This analysis is Part 2 of a series on known risk factors associated with COVID-19. We aim to use publicly available data sets to identify national and subnational populations most at risk for infection and case fatality. The analysis will be updated as we receive additional data.*

## Background
The observed cross-country differences in the number of tests and infection and mortality rates as it relates to COVID-19 have provided a source for theorizing on factors that may lead to different outcomes across the globe. The first part of this series focused on the demographic and behavioral factors at the country-level that may cause increased stress on health systems in responding to COVID-19. Although demographic and behavioral factors clearly are an important piece of the puzzle in explaining the degree of risk countries face, it also brings into question the level of preparedness and capacity of countries in dealing with pandemics in the first place. 

The purpose of this article is to examine health capacity and preparedness at the country level to comparatively assess the resources available in combating COVID-19. In doing so, this article will be split into two parts. First, the focus will be on general health systems capacity, assessed by reviewing health input indicators such as hospital beds per 10,000 inhabitants, doctors per 10,000 inhabitants, and nurses per 10,000 inhabitants. The second part will address the concept of preparedness and response to outbreaks, giving particular emphasis to the [Global Health Security Index](https://www.ghsindex.org/). 

## Structural Capacity:

Defining system capacity for any realm of public policy is difficult given the numerous actors and the multiple levels of government involved. This is particularly true concerning health systems, which incorporate a complex set of issues and dimensions of governance. As it relates to comparative assessment of country health systems, the [structural capacity](https://www.rwjf.org/en/library/research/2012/11/the-journal-of-public-health-management---practice-focuses-on-pu/defining-organizational-capacity-for-public-health-services-and-.html) of countries refers to the informational, organizational, physical, human, and fiscal resources available. 

While there are many measures of health system capacity, the most immediate ones as they relate to assessing the risk countries face in the COVID-19 pandemic and for which there is systemic and complete data are Hospital Beds per 10K, Doctors per 10K, and Nurses and Midwives per 10K collected by the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/). 

## Factor 1: Hospital beds per 10K
A significant amount of attention has been paid to the capacity of countries and regions to adequately provide attention to severe and critical cases of COVID-19. While the sheer numbers will likely overwhelm every health system in the world, the number of hospital beds serves as an important proxy to assess capacity to provide care to patients.

The most recent data from the World Health Organization suggests significant path dependency and political legacy in hospital bed density. In total, 17 of the top 25 countries are former Soviet republics or allied countries, and one country (Germany) that reunified following the fall of the Soviet Union. Beyond these, the data is naturally more heavily skewed towards countries with lower population totals such as East Timor, the Cook Islands, and Barbados, along with several higher income countries including France, Austria, Japan and South Korea.
