When we talk about “open innovation,” we often speak of how essential it is to conduct an in-depth analysis to define the problem or the many steps involved in designing a prize or challenge that uses open innovation to source solutions. Can these learnings be conveyed in 60 minutes or less?

DAI facilitated workshop on open innovation at the Triangle Global Health Conference in Raleigh, North Carolina

At the recent [Triangle Global Health Conference](http://www.triangleglobalhealth.org/annual-conference), Director of Digital/ICT [Krista Baptista](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/krista-baptista) and I tried our luck. We started our workshop by giving participants an overview of open innovation and when we use it. While we provided the concrete benefits of using open innovation to systematically source solutions from a variety of people and groups, the core part of the session was allowing the participants to test out the process themselves. But, instead of asking them to be the “innovators” we asked them to imagine being the individual or organization searching for external solutions. How do you ask others to provide solutions to problems that have, in this case, plagued the public health space for decades? Put simply, how do you draft a “Call?”

## What Is a Call?

The Call is a key element of executing an open innovation competition. Its contents determine the types of solutions that will be provided and who will provide them. Using the [U.S. Global Development Lab](https://www.usaid.gov/GlobalDevLab/about)’s *Tools for Innovation Programming,* we outlined the basic components of a successful Call. They include:

* A well-defined **problem**

* The **barriers** that actors are most struggling to overcome and what change or impact may be critical in addressing the problem.

* A concise **logic statement**, such as: “We are seeking innovations that overcome, leapfrog, or circumvent X barrier to achieve Y outcome.”

* The **criteria** that generally characterize what a successful innovation should achieve or can specifically define selection criteria to be used in the evaluation.

We then gave them a problem—lack of access to medical supplies in rural health clinics. This problem was intentionally vague, allowing participants to define the specifics based on their expertise. In a room full of public health practitioners and experts this was not too difficult. The only restriction was that they had to call for digital solutions.

Perhaps the most valuable part of the exercise was the time spent in groups brainstorming about and then drafting the Call. The participants each had different experiences with the problem and were able to amalgamate their perspectives into one concise Call, allowing for open innovation and co-creation early on in the process.

## Common Challenges with Drafting Calls

After 30 minutes, we brought the groups back together to present their Calls. The responses perfectly portrayed some of the issues involved in looking for external solutions to a problem that you know so well. For example, it is extremely difficult to stop thinking about the solutions and potential actors that could deliver them. One group suggested using drones to deliver medical supplies in their logic statement. Another group called on a partnership between Amazon and UPS to improve delivery to rural areas in the United States. By stating exactly what and who they were looking for, these groups counteracted the purpose of open innovation. Other groups, on the other hand, were able to draft the Call without steering potential respondents in a certain direction. We then had a panel of experts that included Intrahealth’s Director of Digital Health, [Wayan Vota](https://www.intrahealth.org/people/wayan-vota); North Carolina State’s Associate Dean for Research in the College of Natural Resources, [Marian McCord](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/directory/mmccord/); and DAI’s Global Health Practice Lead, [Kirsten Weeks](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/kirsten-weeks), evaluate the groups to determine which one best addressed the components of an effective Call. The winning team’s Call is included here:

Open Innovation Call.

Understanding open innovation and designing a competition to respond to a well-defined problem does take time, but a 60-minute workshop can illuminate the opportunity that open innovation presents, the typical problems we often face when using it, and how to get started drafting the Call.
