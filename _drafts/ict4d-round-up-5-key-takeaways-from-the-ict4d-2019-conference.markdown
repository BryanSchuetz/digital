This year's [ICT4D Conference](https://www.ict4dconference.org/) took place alongside Lake Victoria in gorgeous Kampala, Uganda. It was my first time attending, and it was great to catch up with friends and colleagues (old and new) and marvel at how much bigger the ICT4D sector is now than when I first joined it in late 2010 and [Ken Banks](https://twitter.com/kiwanja) held my champagne at a super-fancy telecoms summit in London, where we had both been invited to speak on the *one* mobile for social good panel (true story!).

If you were paying attention on Twitter during the conference, you'll know there was some criticism about how [every ICT4D conference is the same](https://twitter.com/kiwanja/status/1123839831136718850). I hear that criticism, but to me this one felt different. The promise - and terror - of advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence and 5G raised new conversations, and the availability of data has largely shifted the discussion from 'how do we get data?' to 'how do we make this abundance of data useful?'.

My five key takeaways, in no particular order, can be found below.

1. **The importance of investing in digital literacy:** I was super pleased to see that, in addition to the one panel I organized on this topic, speaker across the conference were raising the issue of digital literacy and how crucial it is to our efforts in the digital for development field. I'm thrilled that this was one of the key conversations at the conference and hope we can hear more about it - including progress made! - in 2019.

2. **New types of (somewhat Dystopian) challenges need new (citizen-empowering) solutions:** There are some really big challenges out there: large-scale electricity outages, internet black outs, surveillance state use of AI, for example. These are things that we may need to deal with more as the number of autocratic leaders grow globally and China and Russia export their internet governance model. The ICT4D community will need to work more closely with our colleagues in both infrastructure and governance to really develop solutions that tackle these complex times.

3. **Data is meaningless without data culture:** Despite the obsession with data that has defined a lot of the ICT4D universe over the past few years with the advent of Big Data, there are still real challenges around getting decision makers at the highest levels to actually use the data that last mile stakeholders like village health workers are working incredibly hard to collect. Building bottom up support and movement at the mid-level of bureaucracies can create positive change for digital policy at the national level.

4. **App overload still plagues ICT4D:** Walking to one of the sessions, I heard a man complain that he'd heard about so many apps, every session seemed to have a new app to discuss, but there's no ability to understand which actually work and have scaled. He is right. There's still app mania in the sector and, beyond that, there's still persistent challenges with duplication of efforts and poor quality control. Beyond some of the regulatory moves like [what Uganda did to quell the mHealth pilotitis crisis](https://www.ictworks.org/ugandan-mhealth-moratorium-good-thing/#.XNsR9xRKiUl), I'm not sure how we tackle the beast that is the app obsession.

5. **Scale still needs to be defined - and proven:** People like to get on stage and announce big user numbers - it's one of the norms of conference life. But this norm needs to be changed. Getting real about what scale actually means - active users vs. just users, for example - will help the whole sector be more transparent and collaborative around digital platforms, and while big numbers should be celebrated, so should strong partnerships and smart decisions that bring efficiency to the market and a better, more feature-rich experience for the user.

That's it from this end for ICT4D 2019! I hope that 2020 captures some of the insights above.
