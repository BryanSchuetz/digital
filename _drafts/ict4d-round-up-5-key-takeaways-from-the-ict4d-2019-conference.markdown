This year's [ICT4D Conference](https://www.ict4dconference.org/) took place alongside Victoria Lake in gorgeous Kampala, Uganda. It was my first time attending, and it was great to catch up with friends and colleagues old and new and marvel at how much bigger the ICT4D sector is now than when I first joined it in late 2010 and [Ken Banks](https://twitter.com/kiwanja) held my champagne at a super-fancy telecoms summit in London, where we had both been invited to speak on the *one* mobile for social good panel (true story!).

If you were paying attention on Twitter during the conference, you'll know there was some criticism about how [every ICT4D conference is the same](https://twitter.com/kiwanja/status/1123839831136718850). I hear that criticism, but to me this one felt different. The promise - and terror - of advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence and 5G raised new conversations, and the availability of data has largely shifted the discussion from 'how do we get data?' to 'how do we make this abundance of data useful?'. My five key takeaways, in no particular order, can be found below.

* Importance of investing in digital literacy

* There are some really big challenges out there, like electric outages, internet black outs--- these are things that we may need to deal with more as the number of autocratic leaders grow globally/ China and Russia export their internet governance model

* Building bottom up support and movement can create positive change for digital policy at the national levelt
  o   Demonstrating demand from CSOs, businesses, other for open data and getting govt to open data/ invest in this
